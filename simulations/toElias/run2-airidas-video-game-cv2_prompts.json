I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.

Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\nFriend: oh\nPersona: real-life was so much better\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\nFriend: eh? like which one\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: on yeah - maybe\nFriend: bypassing rules to benefit one self\nPersona: both deprive quality of life when using content\nFriend: could be a good point in certain areas of the gig economy\nPersona: its similar to the \"remove ads\" model :D\nPersona: Lol lets talk to Jens about piracy and equality in income distribution\nPersona: We will learn this in macro\nPersona: Income distribution\nPersona: so I am pro pirating KEA books haha :D\nPersona: If I could never pirate Adobe Premier or Sony Vegas - I would never became a videomaker. Now I am and in 2 - 5 years, i will probably have a legal copy of this software.\nFriend: but maybe it's still not very good at redistribution\n\nbecause it's flat fee\n\nand doesn't depend on cosumption\nPersona: but they suffer the extra quality of life debuffs from pirating content. Later when they get more wealthy, the quality of life debuffs get too annoying and relative too big as your time becomes more expensive - they buy content.\nFriend: ye. richer people\n\nor actually the one that pay for it\n\nare the ones that fund it\nPersona: with piracy, poor ppl can afford a lot of digital content\nPersona: I think piracy is a really good income distribution tool :D\nPersona: Yet I am missing out on some benefits but they are too small for me to stop pirating music\nPersona: For music - I pirate 100%, since I use Vanced. And actually I was about to stop that and switch to Spotify, but then I discovered Youtube music.\nPersona: and its far easier to pirate as the movie is always 'single-player' and you cant mod it lol.\nPersona: Sometimes I go to premiers in cinemas as they are a slithly different thing. But cinema cant be the legit version always, as it only has thr new movies. \nAmazon or Google play is too expensive for me currently\nPersona: simply because Netflix cost is higher than the cost of pirating films\nPersona: However I still pirate 99% of all the films I watch\nPersona: For games I also feel like some indie game developera really deaserve the support\nPersona: as it also removes the pirating hasslr\nPersona: In the long-term atleast for me the benefits of a legal game copy outweights the price of the game\nPersona: Even though there are pirated workarounda it just gets too annoying to manage\nPersona: Also Steam is great. Its easier to have all the games at one place, auto-save to cloud progress etc. Be able to access Steam UI while in-game.\nPersona: same with Rimworld - its a SP game, but its so much easier to manage the 100 mods if you have it on steam\nPersona: Its so much easier to mod minecraft and play multiplayer if you buy it\nPersona: because pirated minecraft barely gives suffcient minecraft exeprience\nFriend: java version\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: rn I will go watch a film in VR\nPersona: Good idea\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: but in VR\nPersona: Tactical FPS\nPersona: This is like insurgency\nPersona: I think I will buy Onward\nFriend: would be handy\nFriend: could possibly bring the microwave from upstairs so we can do microwavable stuff right there xD\nFriend: everyone has been invited\nso I need to check the place out\nhave to figure out now\nchairs\ntables\ninternet\nfood and drinks\nPersona: and the vr gang\nPersona: so patryk, edward, toby\nPersona: Which are the 'vr gang' and people from past lan party\nFriend: so any action games \n\nfps \n\nmight not be good\nPersona: If you wanna do max 5 ppl, then lets pick out the most important ones\nFriend: problem with common area is the internet might not be amazing\nPersona: I dont feel like making decisions today - I'll order tmmrow xd\nFriend: ok :D but that's gonna be way over 5 households\nI might have to be careful then\nPersona: Ask how much of your roomies and the other people you mentioned are in. We will also hit up other people from past last parties\nPersona: lol of course\nFriend: if you want\n\nI'd like one too\nPersona: should I order rn?\nFriend: so we can play VR chat but be next to each other\nFriend: saturday\nPersona: What do you mean here?\nFriend: ok\ndid you get mobile pay? I can send you mone\nPersona: anyways, so I am buying it\nPersona: I'll need the cavble\nPersona: Anyways\nPersona: oh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: My intuition, from playing games, where blurred or out of focus content is 'locked' or 'not awarded yet', says that those are non-clickable\nPersona: The blurs on those help to focus attention to content, however, I caught myself not knowing where is the menu until I noticed them. They don't intuitively seem to be clickable or working\nPersona: Well not counter-intuitive, but unintuitive\nPersona: Yet it was a little bit counter ituitive\nPersona: There is not much to it for now as I see\nPersona: Btw I checked your webpage :D\nI see that you are doing those 'anti-mainstream' designs which I really appreciate because I want to vomit from the mainstream web UI's these days\nPersona: yeaaaaah, it just sucks because I used it a lot in Atom and Sublime\nFriend: too much time invested and probably not worth it but a possibility\nFriend: and if you find the differences in the RTF code, you can edit the extension so it can give you what you need\nFriend: assuming here\nFriend: must be something with the RTF language\n\nand mindjet can't read the one from this plugin\n\nbut word reformats it probably after its pasted\nFriend: sometimes weird things like that work :D\nPersona: THen it works\nFriend: what if you copy from word to mindjet mindmanager?\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: but it does not work on Mindjet Mindmanager\nPersona: Yes, I know it works on word\nFriend: after installing it, you don't just copy-paste text\nFriend: it worked\n\nit's just that you might not be copying it the right way\nFriend: never tried that\n\nsince the vscode editor is just html js and css I see why you need an extension\nFriend: oh so you want it to keep color etc?\nPersona: However, I need to pasteit into a MindJet application, where the result looks like this\nPersona: editor.action.clipboardCopyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction\ncommand works only for Microsoft apps like Word,\nPersona: This plug-in seems to just add like some weird RTF code to the clipboard.\nPersona: I cant figure out how to properly copy as RTF. I could do this in sublime and Atom\nPersona: I am having one issue\nFriend: is really helpful when finding regression bugs \nor trying to figure out why was something changed\n\nwithout having to go and look up commits in your git program\nFriend: the one feature I got in love with at work is gitLens \n\nwhen you are on a line, you get on the right of it text of the last editor, their commit text and time\n\nand you can even see what was written last\nFriend: I loved some features, but there is nothing that I'm missing in vscode\n\nI like code more actually\n\nThere are some really cool usermade extensions\nFriend: I guess\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\nPersona: cant wait to meet\nPersona: AMAZING\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\nFriend: Yess!\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\nPersona: ok\nFriend: Yes\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\nFriend: weird\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\nPersona: the wall changes color\nPersona: so look at the wall\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\nFriend: i haven't had any updates to it. Don't think mine does  that\nFriend: really?\nPersona: and the game now looks so god damn blue\nPersona: yeah, its so weird now, because it auto turns of when you play games\nFriend: flux is life\n\npeople ask me why is my screen yellow \nI don't even notice cause eyes get used to it\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out. Cuz people will try\nPersona: jesus :D\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\nPersona: do you use flux?\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: stayed until 4 am\nPersona: the second option...\nFriend: you had an all nighter with two crowns? or linux debugging\nFriend: Don't say you quit or I kill you\nFriend: Was thinking about it\nYou aren't in teams either\nPersona: Guess why I am not at school :D\nPersona: so its prob the two crowns for pc.

Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\nPersona: Looks quite similar\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: :D\nPersona: EXTENDED REALITY\nPersona: its actually ER.\nFriend: after ppl are back from work, the most important things:\nvideo games\nweed\npizzas\nlongboard or homefitness\nPersona: life just got boring\nPersona: I am everything thats with VR since today\nPersona: i am in\nFriend: I'm sure you'd have a good time too\nFriend: Emilio loved it there even tho he didn't smoke\nFriend: think you'd be in love with the aarhus life :D\nFriend: would be so fun for you to visit them\nFriend: like harry potter shit or something\n\nwhere movements would get you to do shit\n\nwrong movements can fuck you up\nFriend: my friend that went to Aarhus got a VR \n\nhe studied same as me\n\nwants to dev games tho\n\nstudied a bit of unity\n\nwants to make vr games\nPersona: the timemark 4:10 in the video you gave the link to me is very cool :DDD\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you told me\nFriend: ah ok\nPersona: I did\nPersona: you didn't\nFriend: where did i say 4 10\nPersona: man feels so real\nPersona: 4:10\nPersona: lets do airsoft\nFriend: what? 4:10 what\nPersona: I am in\nPersona: cool\nPersona: oh paintball\nFriend: but we can still go tho\n\n2m distance!\nPersona: 4:10 in the video you said\nFriend: teacher said maybe after corona\nFriend: someone said paintball in todays class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Stef streamed games from steam last night\nNot sure how\nPersona: I will try to pirate SP games tho as it did work for you\nFriend: Ah nice\nPersona: Multiplayer\nFriend: Mp?\nPersona: so its worth it\nPersona: Ones with MP for now\nPersona: I will buy a few games\nPersona: I am ven TPB does not work anymore\nPersona: I think tho, I am tired of pirated\nPersona: yeah I saw a bit of it\nFriend: Oh okay you know it\nPersona: but getting closer\nFriend: Sword art online\nAnime\nThey are in a video game\nPersona: not SAO yet\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: I felt really happy today because of exactly that\nFuture is here\nI got all I need\nI'm a video game addict and all I ever wanted was SAO like experience\nPersona: they*\nPersona: I just wish the fix the bug\nFriend: :D\nPersona: im like so amazed atm\nPersona: this feels so future\nPersona: and has no Multiplayer\nPersona: Other way is using oculus TV app but it does not make it a cinema\nPersona: Bigscreens fixed their bug\nPersona: unless\nPersona: the only prob tho is that i need to control the film in my pc - cant do it through the headset if I want soft coded subs\nPersona: so dude, are u down seeing a movie someday\nPersona: so both of us can watch it\nPersona: I can join with ppl together\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nope I never got this\nPersona: xdddd\nFriend: walking and running when you get off the threadmil becomes super entertaining :D you feel like sonic\nFriend: have you run on a threadmill for a while?\nI have the feeling as if I'm moving super super fast, when I get off of it\nFriend: xD yeah, my mind was playing tricks on me \n3d things became even more 3d coming at me (because of beatsaber)\nPersona: as if they were 3D\nPersona: I can see letter pop out in computer screen\nPersona: its so weird after I used VR\nPersona: I dont have big cable\nFriend: :D can play while charging with big cable\nPersona: wish I could play more, but battery is dead xd\nPersona: so you feel like inside it\nPersona: also the scalr of the environment is kinda like real life\nPersona: You follow the story, and with your actions you can choose which side are you on\nPersona: I just raided a mansion full of people\nPersona: Its a story game with free play elements.
