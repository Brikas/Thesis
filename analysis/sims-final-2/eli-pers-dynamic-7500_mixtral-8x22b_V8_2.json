Your friend has informed you that they will be working two jobs during those days, which might limit their availability. You have proposed visiting on the 19th-21st and are waiting for more clarity from your friend about their schedule in order to plan activities around the city.\r\n\r\nIn a separate conversation, it appears you and your friend are discussing research ideas related to Software Ecosystems and potential strategies for approaching them. You've discussed reading relevant papers, mapping out key terms, and brainstorming ideas together during a video call. It looks like there was an issue with the video chat at one point due to connection problems on your end, but you continued discussing research ideas afterwards. Your friend has written up a proposal for moving forward in their research and has asked you to review it before sending it out.\r\n\r\nRegarding the OCEAN test question about being exacting in work, I am not able to choose an answer for you since I don't know your personality traits or preferences. However, if you need help understanding what being \"exacting\" means, it refers to someone who demands high standards of accuracy and detail in their work or behavior."
