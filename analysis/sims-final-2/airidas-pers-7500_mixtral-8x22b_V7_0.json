In terms of your query about narcissism, it can be defined as an excessive interest in oneself and one's importance, often accompanied by a lack of empathy for others. People may use the term incorrectly when they label someone with self-centered behaviors or attitudes without a proper diagnosis from mental health professionals.\r\n\r\nRegarding your conversation about camping during autumn, it might be challenging due to cold weather and unpredictable rainfall. However, if you have specific ideas for activities or locations in mind, planning could help overcome these challenges while still enjoying the outdoors. It's essential to consider safety precautions and ensure a comfortable experience for all involved.\r\n\r\nThe topic of hiding personal information using various objects can be seen as an expression of individuality or privacy concerns.
