Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website. And I think at \u201eMaigold\u201c there\u2019s a lot of classes and you can also pay in cash\nFriend: And we\u2018ve been to the cute girl from \u201ehouse of healing\u201c\nFriend: You can go to Green Yoga (I think it\u2019s called). There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github.

Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

Alisa was sweet and keys worked:)\nFriend: Oh and could u please so kind and send me photos of the letters? \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already.

In one of them are sheets\nFriend: Otjerwise there are sheets on the locker in the bedroom\nFriend: Maybe the sheets are in the dryer?\nFriend: Urban sports\nFriend: Btw where r the sheets? And what is app where u found meditation/yoga sessions?\nFriend: Decent. Alisa was sweet and keys worked:)\nFriend: Oh and could u please so kind and send me photos of the letters? \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website. And I think at \u201eMaigold\u201c there\u2019s a lot of classes and you can also pay in cash\nFriend: And we\u2018ve been to the cute girl from \u201ehouse of healing\u201c\nFriend: You can go to Green Yoga (I think it\u2019s called). There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already.

In one of them are sheets\nFriend: Otjerwise there are sheets on the locker in the bedroom\nFriend: Maybe the sheets are in the dryer?\nFriend: Urban sports\nFriend: Btw where r the sheets? And what is app where u found meditation/yoga sessions?\nFriend: Decent. Alisa was sweet and keys worked:)\nFriend: Oh and could u please so kind and send me photos of the letters? \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website. And I think at \u201eMaigold\u201c there\u2019s a lot of classes and you can also pay in cash\nFriend: And we\u2018ve been to the cute girl from \u201ehouse of healing\u201c\nFriend: You can go to Green Yoga (I think it\u2019s called). There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already.

In one of them are sheets\nFriend: Otjerwise there are sheets on the locker in the bedroom\nFriend: Maybe the sheets are in the dryer?\nFriend: Urban sports\nFriend: Btw where r the sheets? And what is app where u found meditation/yoga sessions?\nFriend: Decent. Alisa was sweet and keys worked:)\nFriend: Oh and could u please so kind and send me photos of the letters? \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already.

In one of them are sheets\nFriend: Otjerwise there are sheets on the locker in the bedroom\nFriend: Maybe the sheets are in the dryer?\nFriend: Urban sports\nFriend: Btw where r the sheets? And what is app where u found meditation/yoga sessions?\nFriend: Decent. Alisa was sweet and keys worked:)\nFriend: Oh and could u please so kind and send me photos of the letters? \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga.

Alisa was sweet and keys worked:)\nFriend: Oh and could u please so kind and send me photos of the letters? \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already.

In one of them are sheets\nFriend: Otjerwise there are sheets on the locker in the bedroom\nFriend: Maybe the sheets are in the dryer?\nFriend: Urban sports\nFriend: Btw where r the sheets? And what is app where u found meditation/yoga sessions?\nFriend: Decent. Alisa was sweet and keys worked:)\nFriend: Oh and could u please so kind and send me photos of the letters? \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already.

In one of them are sheets\nFriend: Otjerwise there are sheets on the locker in the bedroom\nFriend: Maybe the sheets are in the dryer?\nFriend: Urban sports\nFriend: Btw where r the sheets? And what is app where u found meditation/yoga sessions?\nFriend: Decent. Alisa was sweet and keys worked:)\nFriend: Oh and could u please so kind and send me photos of the letters? \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga.

Alisa was sweet and keys worked:)\nFriend: Oh and could u please so kind and send me photos of the letters? \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website. And I think at \u201eMaigold\u201c there\u2019s a lot of classes and you can also pay in cash\nFriend: And we\u2018ve been to the cute girl from \u201ehouse of healing\u201c\nFriend: You can go to Green Yoga (I think it\u2019s called). There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you can also just go on their website and watch their videos \"Economy for the Common Good\"\nFriend: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes I think all of them are doing that\nFriend: NOT WITH MY SLIPPER OMG\nPersona: Hahahahahah\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: Damn\nPersona: Looks insane!\nFriend: Yepppp\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: U need help?\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\nPersona: Cute\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Love this video\nPersona: Me2\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\nPersona: Thank you:)!\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\nFriend: So cute!!!!\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Emma is gone already?\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\nFriend: I hope so.

They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nFriend: no worries maan\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nFriend: this song is so good\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website.

There you can pay cash as much as you want\u2026 I think\nFriend: It\u2019s called urban sports\nFriend: There\u2019s two wooden boxes.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already.
