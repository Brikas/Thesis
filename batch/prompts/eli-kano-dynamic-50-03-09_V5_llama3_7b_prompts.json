It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?).

But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I don\u2019t know Alfred\u2019s\\nFriend: You missed a call from Christian.\\nFriend: Does Alfred have a god complex\\nPersona: Tell me more!\\nPersona: Is Eugene doable or terrible?

Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\\nFriend: ai chat\\nPersona: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\\nFriend: ai chat\\nPersona: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it.

But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Same - Updated MCMR\\nPersona: I updated quite some stuff in Micro, and a little in ML\\nFriend: Hey man, thanks, I'll check it out!\\nPersona: Did a few micro notes yesterday, not anything special\\nFriend: Hey, don't delete the date tags yet for this month, I haven't copied info from yours yet\u0104\\nFriend: !*\\nPersona: I did some moving of topics\\nPersona: I didn\u2019t know how 2 show w/ tags.

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow.

But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail.

If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

I feel like that\u2019s the only real struggle 4 me. Specifically, that the chronology of the paper is coherent, and that it does not jump over 2 big gaps in between paragraphs. Does it make sense?:)\\nFriend: Please don\u2019t read it yet. Only the table of content is worth to look at perhaps. I\u2019m at the visas office rn and feeling pretty stressed out. I wanna finish send you the newest draft in an hour (maybe I should put it in docs, so I don\u2019t waste transfer time, and you can see it whenever online\u2026?)\\nFriend: It's still messy.

Maybe check one of the car sharing platforms, if u want it 2 be green into the root;)\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think so. Anyways, greenwashing is just what it is until it ain\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s like manifestation when it\u2019s by a corporation, imo.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll tell her:)\\nFriend: I know Them. But I don\u2019t any strong opinions of them.

Do you think I'm selling my soul? \ud83d\ude2c especially Ramboll sounded like \"real sustainable\" but not sure, could be real good green washing \ud83d\ude48\\nFriend: Maybe she gets it when she has her period like me.

What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative"

I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail.

This way, you could at least have feedback for the next paper/re-exam :)\\nFriend: I see, the analysis is always the hardest, I\u2019d say. \ud83d\ude0c but maybe you don\u2019t have to be so \u201econcrete\u201c? Maybe you can argue for whatever point you wanna make, with sources you already have?\\nFriend: Hm, maybe you have to think of different steps and loops you have to take to finish an essay/paper. Did you work with a writing plan?\\nFriend: I wish I could learn how 2 convert my time-mgmt mistakes 2 \u201crules\u201d 4 myself the next time, but it always seem 2 be completely new:(\\nFriend: I do\\nFriend: Already at the smoothie place tho. It\u2019s good!\\nFriend: I\u2019d rather Hand in at the re-exam (it\u2019s the same assignment) than 2 hand in smth I\u2019m not proud of. The conclusion paragraph won\u2019t be hard, it\u2019s the analysis stuff that bugs me - 2 find citations from old academics on a future topic\\nFriend: It\u2019s one of your first papers. I think, you don\u2019t have to be perfect. You can see it as a first trial, no? :) and in any case you learned a lot for the next time regarding time management and structuring stuff. :)\\nFriend: Do you have grammarly or a similar Programm? I think, it would help to let it run through something like this? :) just to have some quick fixes \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Also if you want to safe some time, you can also just go to Caf\u00e9 Kraft to work from there.

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oki, just send it to me when you feel like sending.\\nFriend: At 11.00 tmr\\nFriend: I'm pretty flexible today.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically.

One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\\nFriend: For example these lines, specifically only triggered when Adobe Acrobat is open saved me so much hassle\\nFriend: Adobe acrobat is very limited in key remappings, so with Autohotkey I can bypass that. Also the annoying copy paste behavior where it adds line breaks is annoying as hell, so this fixes it\\nFriend: Most of then I used for Mindmanager\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I see you are enjoying the monkeys\\nPersona: Yeah They where sweet, except when they stole my moms sandwich\\nFriend: Did you pet them?\\nPersona: No actually not, my parents said it was a bad idea\\nPersona: Any news about Bella sky or guldsmeden?\\nFriend: I will need your cv\\nPersona: I Will send it to u now\\nFriend: I will send it to her.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends"

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc96\\nFriend: Same\\nPersona: Amazing life!\\nFriend: Ir is\\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I am in bed\\nFriend: and I was sleeping\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: show me the letter\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\\nFriend: pleasee\\nFriend: make a photo\\nPersona: H\nUnderground now\\nPersona: Come if u don't wanna miss out\\nFriend: I don't want to, but I am in bed with pyjama and I am really tired and sleepy...\\nFriend: So I don't have energy to come\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\\nFriend: But I want to tell you that it was a pleasure for me to meet you\\nFriend: and I will visit you one day!\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd29\\nPersona: \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Elias\\nFriend: how are you?\\nFriend: \u2764\u2764\\nPersona: I\u2019m good.

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense).

So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I don\u2019t think I should come by, since I\u2019m sort of sick\\nFriend: ahh of course\\nPersona: Did u attend all of the KLC classes?

What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative"

And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends"

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I was in Beijing\\nPersona: I exactly what I wished 2 hear:)\\nFriend: But I\u2019ve been to shanghai loads\\nFriend: Sports trips and stuff\\nPersona: I\u2019m getting a little stoked now\\nFriend: It\u2019ll be super exciting\\nPersona: R u happy u got to Taiwan?\\nFriend: Honestly I\u2019ve overlooked that university- thought hongkong was the only place available\\nFriend: Yea I can\u2019t wait !!

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cuz driving\\nPersona: Only 1 person has 2 do it\\nFriend: okay so we I did submit\\nFriend: I did*\\nFriend: I sent him an email\\nPersona: The format is broken 4 me.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I don\u2019t think I should come by, since I\u2019m sort of sick\\nFriend: ahh of course\\nPersona: Did u attend all of the KLC classes? I only went 2 half of them\\nPersona: If yes, do u have notes from sessions/lectures: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 that you'd like 2 share?:) I have the rest in markdown or pdf\\nFriend: yeah will send in a bit\\nFriend: thats my whole mmap\\nFriend: feels good to send note to some1 without haveing to explain wtf I just sent\\nFriend: notes*\\nPersona: I know what u mean!\\nPersona: I saw u didn't have notes from L5, where I was in class\\nFriend: thanks man\\nPersona: ofc:)\\nFriend: I missed this case\\nFriend: will be interesting to read\\nFriend: Elias, you @ egment now?\\nPersona: No. Im at a camp on fyn\\nFriend: ahhh okay\\nFriend: have fun\\nPersona: Thx! What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cuz driving\\nPersona: Only 1 person has 2 do it\\nFriend: okay so we I did submit\\nFriend: I did*\\nFriend: I sent him an email\\nPersona: The format is broken 4 me.

The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before.

One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming?

Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\\nFriend: For example these lines, specifically only triggered when Adobe Acrobat is open saved me so much hassle\\nFriend: Adobe acrobat is very limited in key remappings, so with Autohotkey I can bypass that.

It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit"

What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: We r going 2 the pyramid.

What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: When is Aziz leaving ?\\nPersona: The 3rd\\nFriend: Fuck\\nPersona: He\u2019ll be in sofia at 13\\nPersona: When will u be here the 3rd?\\nFriend: Yeah no I'm leaving Vidin at 12\\nFriend: Wait I haven't bought the tickets\\nFriend: I have to choose now\\nPersona: Can u buy earlier?\\nPersona: So u can see Aziz\\nFriend: It takes 5 hours to go to Sofia\\nPersona: Ohh....\\nFriend: I'm calling the girls, I might be cancellin Vidin\\nPersona: Hey Matis it's Aziz\\nPersona: I want to say bye to you\\nPersona: I will book my ticket today most probably it's on the 3rd of May at 13:something from sofia\\nPersona: I have an option to go from Blago as well at 11am\\nPersona: In which case I can see you\\nFriend: I'm coming back to Blago at 8pm\\nFriend: On Monday\\nFriend: I'll be in Sofia around 5\\nFriend: If I stick to the plan\\nFriend: For fucks sake\\nFriend: That's so annoying\\nFriend: Cuz now I have to choose between seeing you and other ABS or Mihi and Dani\\nPersona: It's okay if you have plans already\\nPersona: We can just do a face time goodbye\\nPersona: Remember u r still going 2 see all except Aziz\\nFriend: I missed my train but luckily I managed to take the bus\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: How was yesterday?\\nPersona: Did u sleep 2 long?\\nFriend: Yeah I woke up at 7\\nPersona: Yesterday was cool\\nPersona: We met some rappers\\nFriend: Nice hahaha\\nPersona: R u in the bus now?\\nFriend: Yeah it's all good\\nPersona: How long till u at the girls then?\\nFriend: About 8 hours lol\\nPersona: Shiiit\\nFriend: Hahaha\\nFriend: Yooooo, you in Paris this weekend ?\\nPersona: I\u2019m only in Nice sry\\nPersona: I wish tho\\nPersona: Would be fun\\nFriend: Haha damn, it's too far away from my place\\nFriend: Have fun\\nFriend: And don't a single opportunity to answer ''Nice'' to any comment about your story\\nFriend: Don't miss a single*\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cuz driving\\nPersona: Only 1 person has 2 do it\\nFriend: okay so we I did submit\\nFriend: I did*\\nFriend: I sent him an email\\nPersona: The format is broken 4 me.

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Did you find it?\\nPersona: Why didn\u2019t u come along?\\nPersona: We r all in the big apartment\\nFriend: Wanted to get food first\\nPersona: U could have just eaten here\\nFriend: But kimiah said that they\u2019re cooking so i\u2019m coming\\nPersona: Did the girls ask u 2 come?\\nFriend: Did yall start eating?\\nPersona: Or they just left?\\nPersona: No\\nFriend: Sweet\\nFriend: Be there soon\\nPersona: ?\\nFriend: Nah bro, i asked them if they\u2019re going out \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: So idk if they\u2019d say if i didnt ask lol\\nPersona: This is getting pretty annoying\\nFriend: Yeah it is\\nFriend: But i dont give a shit man\\nPersona: I think we should talk 2 the girls, when u r done skiing\\nFriend: Yeah maybe\\nFriend: Where are you now?\\nPersona: At the big apartment\\nFriend: Filip called you.\\nFriend: Filip called you.\\nPersona: You called Filip.\\nFriend: Filip called you.\\nPersona: You called Filip.\\nFriend: You wanna take my skis and come up?\\nPersona: Bro, I don\u2019t think I can\\nFriend: I wanted to send that at 1pm lol\\nPersona: Oh well\\nFriend: You missed a call from Filip.\\nPersona: Filip missed your call.\\nPersona: CPh village\\nPersona: The doorms we talked about\\nFriend: Thanks Man, i\u2019ll check it out\\nFriend: Did you read for econ?\\nPersona: No, didn\u2019t get 2 it\\nPersona: Don\u2019t u have mobile pay?\\nFriend: Yeah I do\\nFriend: 81939760\\nPersona: Got u\\nFriend: Thx\\nFriend: Filip called you.\\nFriend: Did you guys end up playing?\\nPersona: Nope\\nFriend: I see\\nFriend: Hey man, any plans for tonight?\\nPersona: Just saw now, I\u2019m in Jylland this weekend\\nFriend: Got it\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Btw can u give me an estimate on when the next person (or u) will be here, so I know which things 2 leave in the fridge, and how much water 2 give 4 the plants:)\\nFriend: Gr8 job by Phil, who I know picked the vacuum.
