And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Morning makes sense with energy though\\nPersona: not cold\\nPersona: its fine\\nFriend: 3 outta 3\nIvan lucky too\\nPersona: you definetely deserve the credit for this friend group slam\\nPersona: btw Laura said she wanted to play csgo for a while\\nPersona: you should play with her\\nPersona: or start a Sims famila\\nPersona: family*\\nPersona: she mentioned some wild mods\\nFriend: Yeah\nWe talked about local co op\\nFriend: Would be fun\\nFriend: We can do lan parties :D\\nFriend: This planet game We played with you would be cool if we can be nore\\nFriend: More\\nPersona: csgo?

When I moved in I remember therr was an option but I have no clue who to call\\nPersona: Probably cant do it on Sunday\\nPersona: I did but I still failed somehow\\nPersona: I will try again\\nFriend: So do we play cs go in 2h?\\nPersona: Dude so funny when you message me on steam, I didn't think it was you\\nPersona: I was almost certain it was anna\\nPersona: cause she called me yesterday when I was gaming with my lithuanian friends\\nPersona: and her number was unrecognized\\nPersona: so I ignored it\\nPersona: then she spammed me on msg xd\\nPersona: And today I get a steam message \"hey sweetie\" reply to me on msg\\nPersona: yeah good idea probably\\nPersona: if you live civ and management, strategy games, Rimworld can really suck you in\\nPersona: its so endless its hard to comprehend\\nPersona: I have 600hrs and I still don't know so many things\\nPersona: I play with 100 mods\\nPersona: I can't tell whats a mod and whats official content at this point\\nPersona: Yeah lets play cs2 in 2 hours\\nFriend: Shishhh xd\\nFriend: I will try it when I'm done with thesis\\nPersona: I was showing it to petyo a bit, he played, he liked it as it appears.

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Morning makes sense with energy though\\nPersona: not cold\\nPersona: its fine\\nFriend: 3 outta 3\nIvan lucky too\\nPersona: you definetely deserve the credit for this friend group slam\\nPersona: btw Laura said she wanted to play csgo for a while\\nPersona: you should play with her\\nPersona: or start a Sims famila\\nPersona: family*\\nPersona: she mentioned some wild mods\\nFriend: Yeah\nWe talked about local co op\\nFriend: Would be fun\\nFriend: We can do lan parties :D\\nFriend: This planet game We played with you would be cool if we can be nore\\nFriend: More\\nPersona: csgo?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

When I moved in I remember therr was an option but I have no clue who to call\\nPersona: Probably cant do it on Sunday\\nPersona: I did but I still failed somehow\\nPersona: I will try again\\nFriend: So do we play cs go in 2h?\\nPersona: Dude so funny when you message me on steam, I didn't think it was you\\nPersona: I was almost certain it was anna\\nPersona: cause she called me yesterday when I was gaming with my lithuanian friends\\nPersona: and her number was unrecognized\\nPersona: so I ignored it\\nPersona: then she spammed me on msg xd\\nPersona: And today I get a steam message \"hey sweetie\" reply to me on msg\\nPersona: yeah good idea probably\\nPersona: if you live civ and management, strategy games, Rimworld can really suck you in\\nPersona: its so endless its hard to comprehend\\nPersona: I have 600hrs and I still don't know so many things\\nPersona: I play with 100 mods\\nPersona: I can't tell whats a mod and whats official content at this point\\nPersona: Yeah lets play cs2 in 2 hours\\nFriend: Shishhh xd\\nFriend: I will try it when I'm done with thesis\\nPersona: I was showing it to petyo a bit, he played, he liked it as it appears.

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think.

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think.

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard.

Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think.

I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

When I moved in I remember therr was an option but I have no clue who to call\\nPersona: Probably cant do it on Sunday\\nPersona: I did but I still failed somehow\\nPersona: I will try again\\nFriend: So do we play cs go in 2h?\\nPersona: Dude so funny when you message me on steam, I didn't think it was you\\nPersona: I was almost certain it was anna\\nPersona: cause she called me yesterday when I was gaming with my lithuanian friends\\nPersona: and her number was unrecognized\\nPersona: so I ignored it\\nPersona: then she spammed me on msg xd\\nPersona: And today I get a steam message \"hey sweetie\" reply to me on msg\\nPersona: yeah good idea probably\\nPersona: if you live civ and management, strategy games, Rimworld can really suck you in\\nPersona: its so endless its hard to comprehend\\nPersona: I have 600hrs and I still don't know so many things\\nPersona: I play with 100 mods\\nPersona: I can't tell whats a mod and whats official content at this point\\nPersona: Yeah lets play cs2 in 2 hours\\nFriend: Shishhh xd\\nFriend: I will try it when I'm done with thesis\\nPersona: I was showing it to petyo a bit, he played, he liked it as it appears.

Unless every 5 min or smth it wants to connect to some service\\nPersona: But signing also seems harmless\\nPersona: I will try the other signer\\nFriend: im thinking the same because it would be a different folder so it should just error\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: i'll do my experimentd xd\\nPersona: With both signers it freezes\\nPersona: so either both signers are fucked up or the spoofing fucks it up\\nFriend: sleep tight\nI can't stay up longer\\nPersona: Goognight\\nPersona: Or it might be the apktool too...\\nPersona: messing with it\\nPersona: I can test for that, but ahhh it takes so long\\nPersona: The Walking Dead is soooooo gooood\\nPersona: holy shit\\nPersona: IT really immerses you\\nPersona: happy eater matd\\nPersona: mate*\\nPersona: easter*\\nPersona: I just woke up\\nFriend: o\nits easter?\nhappy easter :D\\nFriend: i woke recently too\n\nstarted working on the sheet I showed you yesterday\\nFriend: apparently you can get in tivoli\nwith negative test\\nFriend: without a mask\\nPersona: wie\\nPersona: wow\\nPersona: finnally deleted the one drive\\nPersona: folder\\nPersona: Even admin powershell coun;dn't do it\\nFriend: xDD\\nFriend: how did you manage\\nPersona: Downloaded old people and mom type people software \"Wise Force Deleter\" with an UI that just deletes anything\\nPersona: and it worked lol\\nPersona: Maybe my HDD issues will stop now\\nPersona: Cause apparently MS OneDrive posseses power that it cannot handle itselft\\nPersona: As OneDrive and Windows is made by MS, they really sort of a integrate OneDrive into Windows. And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Morning makes sense with energy though\\nPersona: not cold\\nPersona: its fine\\nFriend: 3 outta 3\nIvan lucky too\\nPersona: you definetely deserve the credit for this friend group slam\\nPersona: btw Laura said she wanted to play csgo for a while\\nPersona: you should play with her\\nPersona: or start a Sims famila\\nPersona: family*\\nPersona: she mentioned some wild mods\\nFriend: Yeah\nWe talked about local co op\\nFriend: Would be fun\\nFriend: We can do lan parties :D\\nFriend: This planet game We played with you would be cool if we can be nore\\nFriend: More\\nPersona: csgo?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Morning makes sense with energy though\\nPersona: not cold\\nPersona: its fine\\nFriend: 3 outta 3\nIvan lucky too\\nPersona: you definetely deserve the credit for this friend group slam\\nPersona: btw Laura said she wanted to play csgo for a while\\nPersona: you should play with her\\nPersona: or start a Sims famila\\nPersona: family*\\nPersona: she mentioned some wild mods\\nFriend: Yeah\nWe talked about local co op\\nFriend: Would be fun\\nFriend: We can do lan parties :D\\nFriend: This planet game We played with you would be cool if we can be nore\\nFriend: More\\nPersona: csgo?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think.

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM.

You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think.

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard.

Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think.

I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Morning makes sense with energy though\\nPersona: not cold\\nPersona: its fine\\nFriend: 3 outta 3\nIvan lucky too\\nPersona: you definetely deserve the credit for this friend group slam\\nPersona: btw Laura said she wanted to play csgo for a while\\nPersona: you should play with her\\nPersona: or start a Sims famila\\nPersona: family*\\nPersona: she mentioned some wild mods\\nFriend: Yeah\nWe talked about local co op\\nFriend: Would be fun\\nFriend: We can do lan parties :D\\nFriend: This planet game We played with you would be cool if we can be nore\\nFriend: More\\nPersona: csgo?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Morning makes sense with energy though\\nPersona: not cold\\nPersona: its fine\\nFriend: 3 outta 3\nIvan lucky too\\nPersona: you definetely deserve the credit for this friend group slam\\nPersona: btw Laura said she wanted to play csgo for a while\\nPersona: you should play with her\\nPersona: or start a Sims famila\\nPersona: family*\\nPersona: she mentioned some wild mods\\nFriend: Yeah\nWe talked about local co op\\nFriend: Would be fun\\nFriend: We can do lan parties :D\\nFriend: This planet game We played with you would be cool if we can be nore\\nFriend: More\\nPersona: csgo?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Morning makes sense with energy though\\nPersona: not cold\\nPersona: its fine\\nFriend: 3 outta 3\nIvan lucky too\\nPersona: you definetely deserve the credit for this friend group slam\\nPersona: btw Laura said she wanted to play csgo for a while\\nPersona: you should play with her\\nPersona: or start a Sims famila\\nPersona: family*\\nPersona: she mentioned some wild mods\\nFriend: Yeah\nWe talked about local co op\\nFriend: Would be fun\\nFriend: We can do lan parties :D\\nFriend: This planet game We played with you would be cool if we can be nore\\nFriend: More\\nPersona: csgo?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

When I moved in I remember therr was an option but I have no clue who to call\\nPersona: Probably cant do it on Sunday\\nPersona: I did but I still failed somehow\\nPersona: I will try again\\nFriend: So do we play cs go in 2h?\\nPersona: Dude so funny when you message me on steam, I didn't think it was you\\nPersona: I was almost certain it was anna\\nPersona: cause she called me yesterday when I was gaming with my lithuanian friends\\nPersona: and her number was unrecognized\\nPersona: so I ignored it\\nPersona: then she spammed me on msg xd\\nPersona: And today I get a steam message \"hey sweetie\" reply to me on msg\\nPersona: yeah good idea probably\\nPersona: if you live civ and management, strategy games, Rimworld can really suck you in\\nPersona: its so endless its hard to comprehend\\nPersona: I have 600hrs and I still don't know so many things\\nPersona: I play with 100 mods\\nPersona: I can't tell whats a mod and whats official content at this point\\nPersona: Yeah lets play cs2 in 2 hours\\nFriend: Shishhh xd\\nFriend: I will try it when I'm done with thesis\\nPersona: I was showing it to petyo a bit, he played, he liked it as it appears.

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think.

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM.

You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think.

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard.

Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think.

I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Morning makes sense with energy though\\nPersona: not cold\\nPersona: its fine\\nFriend: 3 outta 3\nIvan lucky too\\nPersona: you definetely deserve the credit for this friend group slam\\nPersona: btw Laura said she wanted to play csgo for a while\\nPersona: you should play with her\\nPersona: or start a Sims famila\\nPersona: family*\\nPersona: she mentioned some wild mods\\nFriend: Yeah\nWe talked about local co op\\nFriend: Would be fun\\nFriend: We can do lan parties :D\\nFriend: This planet game We played with you would be cool if we can be nore\\nFriend: More\\nPersona: csgo?

Or the tower defence one?\\nFriend: Think si\\nFriend: Si\\nFriend: So\\nPersona: Which one?\\nPersona: I think we played the tower defence one\\nPersona: I don't think we ever played Factorio together\\nPersona: But the tower defence one is fun\\nFriend: Ok its the tower def\nBut same as factorio\\nFriend: Factory building\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yes you should \ud83d\ude18\\nPersona: but I can get faster internet here too I think, i just need to pay extra\\nFriend: Set it in calendar\\nFriend: Can you get it now?\\nPersona: 30mbps sucks only when downloading games\\nFriend: And watching 8k porn on vr\\nPersona: xdd I dont think so, I dont even know where to start. When I moved in I remember therr was an option but I have no clue who to call\\nPersona: Probably cant do it on Sunday\\nPersona: I did but I still failed somehow\\nPersona: I will try again\\nFriend: So do we play cs go in 2h?\\nPersona: Dude so funny when you message me on steam, I didn't think it was you\\nPersona: I was almost certain it was anna\\nPersona: cause she called me yesterday when I was gaming with my lithuanian friends\\nPersona: and her number was unrecognized\\nPersona: so I ignored it\\nPersona: then she spammed me on msg xd\\nPersona: And today I get a steam message \"hey sweetie\" reply to me on msg\\nPersona: yeah good idea probably\\nPersona: if you live civ and management, strategy games, Rimworld can really suck you in\\nPersona: its so endless its hard to comprehend\\nPersona: I have 600hrs and I still don't know so many things\\nPersona: I play with 100 mods\\nPersona: I can't tell whats a mod and whats official content at this point\\nPersona: Yeah lets play cs2 in 2 hours\\nFriend: Shishhh xd\\nFriend: I will try it when I'm done with thesis\\nPersona: I was showing it to petyo a bit, he played, he liked it as it appears.

Much faster\\nPersona: I would say I really recomend it\\nFriend: Sounds good\\nPersona: I woouln't*\\nPersona: I dont recomend it very mcuh xd or maybe thats my impression after trying the new version\\nPersona: it almost feels the same as the old, but for someone who never played, Insurgency might be intereating\\nPersona: and terryfying\\nPersona: like this game is so scary, you are advancing and someone lays down some suppressive fire on you.
