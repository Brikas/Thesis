Mutation is the only way currently to make new gene codes which lead to variation. Survival challenge allows natural selection of more optimal gene codes, therefore its naturally forever optimizing\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: *so far\\nPersona: Meaning of life may takr a twist when gene modding gets powerful\\nPersona: Cause literally the only way life can continue to exist is if life is coded to try to reproduce. Mutation is the only way currently to make new gene codes which lead to variation. Survival challenge allows natural selection of more optimal gene codes, therefore its naturally forever optimizing\\nPersona: That explain why we 1) want to fuck 2) take unselfish care of our children\\nPersona: If some individual does noy want to fuck due to gene mutation, they may have a higher fitness score, but that will not be reproduced further\\nPersona: And while the 2nd thing is not as fundamental as the 1st one, selfisly caring for your children is extremely optimal, as species with that gene present significantly incr\u0119ase the chance of their species to continue existing\\nPersona: We therefore are optimized naturally to reproduce\\nPersona: stuff like happiness, art, etc. is just and intermediary\\nPersona: This could be a twist, since the very fundamental.part of reproduction is not neccesary then\\nPersona: probably in some hundreds of year we will not want sex that much\\nPersona: selflessly*\\nPersona: Another question whether there is a meaning to optimizing itself idk\\nPersona: Our lives might be meaningful parts of a meaningless Life optimization function.\\nPersona: bro ignore that, I changed my mind xd\\nFriend: Why\\nFriend: We gotta talk life algorthm some point\\nFriend: Maybe high\nMaybenot\\nPersona: Okay I dont think what I said is wrong, but I think this is just the foundation level, which only applies to very early species and not homo sapiens.\\nPersona: The reason is because as species got more and more fit through the means of genetics, the have increased their ability to build capital. And I think capital in abstract terms is the relevant factor here.\\nPersona: Capital would be something that last more than a single generation. For example knowledge is capital.\\nPersona: And capital is actually another way of increasing fitness of species\\nPersona: So the two ways of increasing fitness 1) genetical mutation 2) capital\\nPersona: And homo sapiens has come to the point where fitness is grown faster using capital than genetical mutation\\nPersona: Genetical mutations take a lot of iterations, and when human life span is increasing (fitness), geneetical advancement is getting slower and slower\\nPersona: but capital advancement is super fast at this point\\nPersona: Genetical advancement is almost irrelevant now\\nPersona: Things like desire for sex, binge eating is the leftover residue\\nPersona: Which was effective back in the day, when capital was low\\nPersona: Thus reproduction as the meaning of life is very very sub-optimal since while atm reproduction is still essential, but it has extremely big diminishing returns. Compared to building capital which have been showing exponential effect latelt\\nPersona: Raising 10 kids instead of 2 will barelly have marginal added value these days\\nPersona: But inventing cures for diseases for example will increase our fitness\\nPersona: And the concept of 'life' or 'being alive', or even being made out of carbon may not even a fundamental thing.\\nPersona: The algorhythm of genetical mutations can have easy analogies in computer system now, thanks to the built up capital. Thus growth in fitness can happen even without the carbon based individuals.\\nPersona: This is what happends beyond technological singularity\\nPersona: Even at this point, when the number of carbon based individual decrease, optimization will continue to happen. The, what now is hard to label, but lets call it \"the state\" will continue to grow its chances of survival (fitness). And probably will eventually end up even in a different form than 'electricity based state'.\\nPersona: So its just a travelling impulse in the universe the changes its shape\\nPersona: Evolutionary mechanism is not even a fundamental part of it.\\nPersona: Evolutionary mechanism as a way to increase fitness did not go extint yet, but its now inferior to capital as a way to increase fitness\\nPersona: basically, idk where I am going with this\\nPersona: But we are basically apart of the 'carbon based state', at the point where capital is the superios way of increasing fitness. We could say we are in the transition to maybe 'electricity based state', where machines take over naturally.\\nPersona: dammn bro\\nPersona: wtf\\nPersona: Makes me feel so little\\nPersona: But lets add death\\nPersona: Im the early carbon based era, when genetical.advancement was superior, death could have been important because it allowed for natural selection. It was a filter for fit genomes. The only way to increase fitness was with compound reproduction, thus old generations were basically useless. Not only were they useless, but also anti-productive as in our carbon era, the carbon energy is limited and overpopulation makes is harder for new genomes to grow. Thus death of old genomes was optimal. Death as optimal.\\nPersona: these days however, while we are still carbon based, genetical growth is no longer the superior method. Thus this crosses out the statement about \"old generation are useless\", that held true before. Even if we are 10 gen behind and we live 1000 years, we can still build capital.\n\nLimited carbon energy is still a factor though, but its unknown whether the cost of extra carbon energy consumed by older individuals is more than added capital advancement from old individuals.\n\nBefore there was a typeof aging \"generational aging\", which is that your repoduction becomes more and more useless as more compound generations are born. This resulted in the natural development of 'biological aging', like I sad before as it was optimal.\\nPersona: But right now generational aging is insigfificant, thus the underlying reason of biological aging is gone.\\nPersona: Its possible though that its still.optimal because old brains tend to be less innovative, less explorative and thus contribute less to capital. Or even have negative effect on capital.\\nPersona: We no longer need reproduction for fitness growth, thus we may be able to have fitness growth without death as we can get rid of overpopulation by not reproducing (or reproducing at a rate = increase in carbon energy generation capacity)\\nPersona: But young people may however have higher contributions to capital though, due to neuroplasticity. So death may still be optimal.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: your excused\\nPersona: I just watched this Danish film\\nPersona: The Celebration\\nPersona: holy shit\\nPersona: very crazy film, its a danish one\\nPersona: the old handheld camera style might throw off, but tust me, I could not take my eyes off\\nPersona: its been a while I was so engaged in the film, I almost watched it twice\\nFriend: Wowow so you\u2019re getting more into the danish culture?\\nPersona: A good film is a good film xd\\nPersona: but yeah\\nPersona: I am\\nFriend: Idk first the song, now a movie\\nFriend: Good\\nPersona: yeah, but I watched some danish ones before\\nPersona: European films overall amaze me often\\nPersona: Europeans are much less reserves to explore topic that would never air on american cinema\\nPersona: reserved*\\nPersona: topics*\\nFriend: I havent watched anything in a long time.

When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient.

Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish.

I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: i will text you when i am home i am in the train\\nPersona: okay no worries\\nFriend: i am home\\nPersona: Whats your address?\\nFriend: Absalonsgade 43\\nFriend: first floor on the right\\nPersona: Alrigjt coming\\nFriend: Hi can you define the two periods in your part\\nFriend: idk what you call them but something like \"initial\" and \"later period\" adn then the years\\nFriend: then i can just reference that in my part\\nPersona: i did\\nPersona: look at the stakholder analysis doc \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: sorry i didnt respond so fast\\nPersona: I stopped at fotex\\nPersona: and bought a pillow\\nPersona: I feel like a grown up lol\\nPersona: Hey it was 27kr for cola and the water\\nPersona: 60905504\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: hahaha\\nFriend: wtf is that?\\nPersona: HelloFresh\\nPersona: Unicorn kit\\nPersona: April fools\\nFriend: how stupid hahah\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: i am still a bit confused about MCMR oral\\nFriend: are they asking about everything or just assignment\\nFriend: everyone says something different\\nPersona: About everything\\nPersona: They will ask about assignment and about everything\\nFriend: ffs\\nFriend: i have to hurry up and read all the stuff\\nPersona: Same\\nPersona: but I was working yday and still working today \ud83e\udd74\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: haven\u2019t started yet either \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Hurry up and start you lazy onee \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: jk just trying to motivate\\nFriend: hahahah\\nFriend: i know\\nFriend: i don\u2019t have time haha\\nPersona: yeah time, wish there was a bit more it\\nFriend: exactly\\nFriend: Hi airi \nSince i am speeking right before you in the part where we talk about furthering the research i made a little segway that fits really well with my part into yours\\nFriend: i will just send what i am thinking of saying so you can see the segway\\nFriend: fuck its spelled segue... segway is those weird scooter types hah\\nPersona: Hey sorry, I missed it, but yeah, that will segway well \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: My friend asked if your horse can do this \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: hahahah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 67.5hrs of work\\nPersona: in one evening\\nPersona: Hazelnuts lidl, 75kr/kg\\nFriend: Shiiiet\nNice\\nFriend: Omw\\nPersona: they are in baking section\\nPersona: I find the last one pretty funny\\nFriend: Makes dudes really industrious and good sales men\\nFriend: \"don't ask the fish how to catch fish.

I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\\nPersona: yo wtf\\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\\nPersona: click the three dots\\nPersona: and there is install app button\\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\\nPersona: thats pretty cool\\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\\nPersona: and mortgages\\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\\nPersona: this is from a book\\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\\nPersona: And things get interesting then\\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\\nPersona: but hmm\\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\\nFriend: to help you get there?\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\\nPersona: Need to fix that\\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: mac and windows brainfuck is real\\nPersona: I keep using Alt+C to copy\\nFriend: How you get in free\\nFriend: Did they catch you\\nPersona: met this Italian girl by the bus stop on friday, we went to roskilde together on Saturday, made out like 100 times, now she been at my place twice, cant kiss her again\\nPersona: fucking\\nPersona: sucks\\nFriend: Why cant\\nPersona: idk no right moment\\nPersona: bruh\\nPersona: I got4000kr money back in utility costs\\nPersona: cha chiiiiing baby\\nPersona: and only 1.2k came from heating overpayment\\nPersona: 2.5k overpaid in electricity \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: fuckinh hell, I wasnt even saving\\nFriend: Were you chilling at your place\\nFriend: How much are they charging you?\n\nI got back a 1000 :D\\nFriend: 5700 from skat too\\nPersona: 3.5k year I think for electricity\\nPersona: idk but a lot\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: but that was time ago right?\\nFriend: Now\\nFriend: When i did full time i was getting 15k+ tax back\\nFriend: They gave youmost back\nYou havent been gome much\\nFriend: Home\\nFriend: I was mining coins one year xD no money back that year\\nPersona: I was usually home\\nPersona: I think\\nPersona: apart from 1mo in summer\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: tax return was in april tho\\nPersona: long time ago\\nFriend: I checked last week\\nFriend: Dodnt know\\nFriend: Hey Airi\\nFriend: What you think for saturday?\\nPersona: Going to lake\\nPersona: maybe 11h\\nFriend: Bbq too or no bbq\\nFriend: Ivan can be here either friday evening or saturday after 12\\nFriend: Who's on board so far?\\nPersona: bbq\\nPersona: Saturday 12 then\\nPersona: I think me, you , arijan,deividas ivan\\nPersona: cound;t get anybody to be up\\nPersona: I connected Revolut, Swedbank and AL Bank to my Personal FInance gooogle spreadsheet.

I am in my cozy bed, listening to macmiller\\nPersona: why matlab tho?\\nFriend: eh mistakes were made. okay, change of the strategy. forget the scale. how does your schedule look like in general\\nFriend: what. how many Polish friends do you have haha. you have more Polish friends than I do\\nFriend: oh no, I was referring to psycho in a common vernacular sense here. I wasn't even considering the psychiatric sense\\nFriend: I wonder whether you'd even feel anything if you fell out. I remember the story of that lady who got sucked out of the window and I think she died almost immediately\\nPersona: a very generalized version look like this\\nFriend: I'm still basically unfurnished so not home much these days\\nFriend: I need it for my potential job and in general it's useful in neuro\\nPersona: possibly. They just keep spawning around me\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude33\\nPersona: there was also a story of a pilot who got sucked out, but somebody held him and he stayed outside of the cabin for a long time and stayed alive.\\nPersona: but yeah, chances could be instant death too\\nPersona: ohhh\\nPersona: why unfurnished?\\nPersona: get furniture!\\nFriend: this is going great haha\\nFriend: also I'm curious what you had to type into Google\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: what is this sorcery. what's your secret\\nFriend: what\\nPersona: ugh I am having a good laugh thanks\\nPersona: it was so genius, I typed \"vertical pattern\"\\nPersona: but come on come on, finish fixing what you started\\nPersona: I think we culturaly match, or we match in humour. Or maybe its because I have soplica\\nPersona: which of the two meanings is more like the \"American Psycho\"?\\nFriend: now I don't want to! I've just come to a conclusion that I'm clearly better at dodgeball than at fixing things. change of career path is canceled\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e inserting Jaros\u0142aw after talking about plane crashes? how dare you\\nFriend: the latter, strangely enough\\nPersona: you were close, I admit it was my mistake this time. Dont give up, resist urge to dodge, sometimes in dodgeball its better to catch it\\nPersona: generally schedule is flexible\\nPersona: doesnt that make Jaroslaws greeting even better here? \ud83c\udf39\u2615\ufe0f\u2615\ufe0f\\nFriend: oh no, now we're having a Schrodinger's schedule\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I'LL GO FIRST\\nFriend: generally I can't do Sat or Sun\\nFriend: and next week I'm pretty booked\\nFriend: but after that I have something on 19, 21, 23, 27, 28.02 and 1.03\\nFriend: you were so close to inserting Jaros\u0142aw at 2137. we would have no choice, but to give you an honorary Polish citizenship if you did that\\nFriend: wait that was ambiguous, I have stuff I need to do on these days. other than that I should be free\\nPersona: I am pretty sure I can adapt to be free most of these days"

Excel opened like 20 tabs of this link. Removing the link also for reason clear the formatting, which is unrelated.

Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish.

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: no worries haha\\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nice\\nPersona: and patryk said he can 19th\\nFriend: I wanna get Madalina to join us but idk\\nFriend: wanna get a date to join me for a sauna and Ivan too xD\\nFriend: but if Liis Patryk and Zoe join it would be fun\\nPersona: a\\nPersona: I can't find the saunagus group anymore\\nPersona: Xdd saunagus date hmmm\\nPersona: oh wait\\nPersona: its not he date\\nPersona: the\\nPersona: The date is the Sweden girl?\\nPersona: If we have all of those poeple then its almost a private sauna\\nFriend: 19th is cancelled man\\nFriend: we cant book it\\nFriend: 24th thursday? 25th is the competition\\nFriend: I see we booked with Patry 1 and 8\\nPersona: yh\\nPersona: yeah 24th I am in\\nFriend: alright booked\\nFriend: if girls want in, better hurry. 4 spots left\\nPersona: can you drop the link again?\\nPersona: booked\\nPersona: and told Liisa, Zoe\\nFriend: noice\\nPersona: Bro, we going saunagus hard\\nPersona: hopefully on the Dec 8th I'll be sitting at the top\\nPersona: Or maybe sooner\\nFriend: sitting where? :D\\nPersona: at the top\\nFriend: we going once a week\nnot too hardcore\\nPersona: like on the highest step\\nFriend: oh\\nFriend: you wanna go higher\\nPersona: Eventually yeah\\nFriend: im chill with middle there :D they strong\\nPersona: Me too prob for the next one\\nPersona: but like after 2 more times, I will be tough and strong saunaman \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\u26d1\\nPersona: :dd\\nPersona: Liisa booked\\nPersona: 24th\\nFriend: ayy :D\\nPersona: But Zoe can't\\nFriend: that's ok\n\nhappy Liis is joining\\nPersona: We can get one more person\\nPersona: I have a speaking disability\\nPersona: I have a hard time saying \"no\"\\nFriend: do you know how to book a study room in cbs\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: one moment\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Maybe\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: Is 11:30 okay?\\nPersona: sorry\\nPersona: 10:30\\nPersona: misclick\\nPersona: 10:30***\\nFriend: Thats cool\\nPersona: 10:40, we a bit late\\nPersona: we won the market run\\nFriend: Congrats!

Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nFriend: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow.

But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nPersona: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nPersona: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nPersona: lets check if other have office hours\\nPersona: Rob also has on Monday...\\nPersona: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish.

I chose the lady\\nPersona: Last weekend, I spend whole Sunday with the italian chick, only to regret it after and realize I am not interested.\\nPersona: Next month Anna is coming over from Poland to my place for a week and I have exam during that time, so it will be a true challenge\\nPersona: I dont want Anna for relationship, but after spending a week with italias girl and relizing that she is pretty uninteresting, a bit negative, not that hot, Anna feels like a relief\\nFriend: we haven't kept in touch lately so idk their names or whatsup\n\nis Anna polish?\\nFriend: I am starting a study journey through gaming\n\nI want to learn more about the world but it's hard to keep entertained\\nFriend: I remember there was a car mechanic game I played as kid and could figure out things wrong with the car by trying to start it and the noise engine made\n\nso playing now car mechanic simulator 2021 :D\\nFriend: want to do house flipper games too\n\nbut first to master the car basics\\nFriend: Dennis just asked for techbbq access :DD we going together?\\nPersona: yeah I saw just now xx\\nPersona: idk\\nPersona: He didnt say  anything\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: the girl from startup idea competition\\nPersona: so now you want to learn to repair cars?\\nFriend: I want as much as possible common knowledge\n\nNeed to learn more about countries and cultures, religion (need to find some good war games. Maybe CIV?)\\nFriend: when we changed your tire I got inspiration\\nFriend: are you gonna go hardcore now that uni starts into social and tech stuff? I want to do tech more\\nFriend: I had a good time at metro, but doing data analysis alone is not the funnest\n\nI want more action\\nFriend: are you gonna take Anna around for stuff or its gonna be more date setting\\nFriend: for tech and Copenhagen exploration\\nPersona: Also movies, documentaries maybe?\\nPersona: the very best and deepest option imo is to travel for that\\nPersona: why did you suddenly decide that you want that, I am curious?\\nPersona: the kicking technoque xdd\\nPersona: well, in that case I have a mysterious issue with my bike - back wheel is not spinning freely, and its not because of the breaks\\nPersona: I been watching some repair vids\\nPersona: Also thinking of changing brake pads, but for disc brakes\\nPersona: Social not the focus now. Did networking last semester, executing and making an attempt at using  learned tech now, but idk how hard yet\\nPersona: Will try to make an MVP\\nPersona: so mostly flutter, design thinking, entrepreneurship, UI, startups\\nPersona: date stuff\\nPersona: But I will take her around cph and thinking of some road trip too\\nPersona: we can organize it together maybe\\nPersona: (But I tell this to you only, I am not considering to be gf bf with her, I need smth better)\\nPersona: I baught a silk pilloecasr for 250kr\\nPersona: to see if it actually improves morning haair and skin\\nPersona: pillowcase*\\nFriend: Yeah\nWould be nice to make a list\n\nI learn the term in bulgarian and english (have usually already heard the word) \n\nLike \u043a\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u0430\u043b\nBut i never knew what it meant\\nFriend: I found some really good explanation vids on yt abouthow disc brakes work. And the different parts. How its connected to the pedal \n\nAnd then i repair the car in game and feels so good knowing the parts :D\\nFriend: When i beat the game I'll ask dad to put me with a mechanic in my city for a day maybe\\nPersona: sounds good. You are really getting deep into car repair xdd\\nFriend: Got my laptop back\n\nI wasted a lot of time playing cabal\nDon't feel productive from it\n\nTo feel productive it is a big jump\nI need to figure a way to automate farming but they ha e serious anti cheat detector so hard to start in that direction\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: There is the thing that autism is harder to detect in adults because when you grow you kind of learn to act normal\\nPersona: but what do you people when you look for contact, people are weirded out? Like these days, right now? Is it only about girls or including boys?\\nPersona: then so many of us may have autism and we are just pretending to act normal lol\\nPersona: Cause honestly, I do act a lot of stuff to reach my goals or make an impression to some person\\nPersona: Maybe I am also an autist then\\nPersona: I don't really know, I think I know too little about it.\\nPersona: for me the better understanding is the word 'weird'\\nFriend: yeah \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nthe thing that prompted me to be curious now is the 5 love languages\\nFriend: have you heard of that thing\\nPersona: is it like words, touch, and some 3 more?\\nFriend: yee ye!\\nFriend: but then there are these 5 others and I'm questioning if those 5 others are the ones for autists\\nFriend: or if normal people can also identify with them\\nPersona: 5 others. Like 5 love languages for autists?\\nFriend: ye :DD\\nFriend: you remember I keep asking to meet and just study together or do our thing but separately\\nFriend: the exact thing is stated as one of them\\nFriend: idk.. would have to test on people if they identify with any of these to see\\nPersona: But why?\\nPersona: Like what does it mean? does it mean that if you like that, you are autistic? I don't think it means that\\nPersona: let me see the rest\\nPersona: Umm but not everything is love, there is also friendship. Maybe if you did the parallel play/body doubling with a girl as a way to express love, maybe then it would fit.\\nFriend: eh.. I think you can express love language with friends, no?\\nPersona: okay maybe thats true, the love languages seem to be more general\\nPersona: the Neurodivergent Love Languages I quickly read through kinda seem fine and normal to me. Maybe world has started to appear more and more fake normal. Or maybe I am autistic xd\\nFriend: ye I'm not sure about you. Need to perform research on others\\nPersona: okay, this may be totally wrong, but maybe you don't act enough? Like when I got out of this no lifer stage of my life, I just kinda acted it out all the time and it then grew on me. Right now I am always trying to act the person that I want to be (a combination of multiple people from real life, TV, moviest, stories). I also sometimes consciously think about it. But in the end it works\\nPersona: If you think you are weird, then I am of the belief that socializing is a muscle and if you train it, it's impossible not to grow it. If there is autism involved, then idk how it works, but maybe its also solvable.\\nFriend: ye. It's not that autism is a drawback, but a different way of working\n\nbetter at one thing, worse at another\n\nso socializing is hard with normies\\nFriend: and yeah because socializing is like you say a muscle, harder to diagnose if you are autist and not normie\\nPersona: better at one thing worse at another is also not neccesarily autism. Lets say you are smart and inteligent, but less good at social. This can be because you just spent more time learning and thinking and less time for socializing.\\nPersona: Do you think that you tried socializing more and more and you didn't feel that you got better?\\nFriend: I definitely got better\nbut autism prolly is real \ni imagine like a predisposition to some stuff\\nFriend: but not necessarily strictly bad at it\\nPersona: its good then, maybe its just a matter of lack of socailization then.\\nPersona: I mean, healthcare is free, just get a test or something. When they say you don't have it, life may become so much easier. Just the confirmation from a doctor that smth is normal helped me so much a few times.\\nFriend: that's also what would be part of the finding if I find if I am autistic or not\n\nbecause it would prove if experiences play a role in it or is it a thing you just have/ have not\\nFriend: was acting like a bipolar person in covid summer because of stress\\nFriend: but I am not (usually) acting on emotion or like that\\nPersona: Did you suddenly get really worried about this or you been thinking about this what you are saying for a while now?\\nFriend: thinking a little \n\never since you said everyone is on the spectrum\\nPersona: Maybe my scale of 'normaliness' ir calibrated a little bit different, cause I view mood swings kinda normal. But idk to what extent you had them.\\nPersona: fuck I may have said that. If I said it then, I probably shounnt've because as you can see I am not really knowledgable about it when its real talk\\nFriend: :D yeah idk much about it either. Never researched\\nFriend: mood swings is no no for me\\nFriend: been very consistent usually\\nFriend: but definitely labeled weird\\nPersona: okay idk man, I feel like whatever I could say is very unscientific. Do your resaearch and maybe lets talk about this later again if you keep thinking about it.\\nFriend: :D yeah\\nFriend: I'm kind of slow on research \n\nand it's a field research confirming my own biases but\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: She said she was very happy with my performance, will talk to bosses\\nPersona: but usually salaeries are negotiated after a year of working she said\\nFriend: Yeah, thats a common practice\\nFriend: Sounds promising, are you satisfied with it?\\nPersona: There is nothing non-negotiable\\nPersona: idk, depends on what she comes back with\\nPersona: Got the raise \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: from 145hr to 175hr\\nFriend: Heyy, congrats!\\nFriend: Well deserved\\nFriend: So everything is going well? How are you?\\nPersona: yeah going well, very busy\\nPersona: idk so weird today after getting the raise I got a weird stress/anxiety even tho there is only to be happy for things\\nPersona: How are you?\\nFriend: Hm, I guess there might be this feeling of greater responsibility even if your role didn\u2019t change.\\nFriend: I\u2019m good, having a great start of the year. Already had a few small accomplishments and working on some more stuff.\\nFriend: I think I finally learned how to better manage my time and work so it helps a lot. I\u2019ve been trying to find the right system since November and it feels like I got this now. So even though I have more projects, there\u2019s almost no stress.\\nPersona: kind of. I will most likely be paid more than most of the rest of students. And so I am worries I will feel an obligation to be better than them.\\nPersona: but thats what I evidebtly was for the past 9 months so I guess nothing changes\\nPersona: what methods did you discover?\\nPersona: share them, I am interested for my own utility \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: spreadsheets?\\nPersona: Hunger is so annoying like, idk what to ea\\nPersona: eat*\\nPersona: I am so bored of cooking and eating\\nPersona: I wish to have like automatic eating\\nFriend: Almost no spreadsheets. Just abusing google calendar and reporting daily to Kinga (it goes both ways). Perfect way to keep ourselves accountable and maintain long distance friendship \ud83e\udd20\\nPersona: how did you manage to do assigments in a week after they are assigned? I would have big will power problems\\nPersona: I've been lately experimenting a lot with calender too, come up with this one method, working good so far, but not mature to share yet\\nPersona: Once a few weeks? :oooo\\nPersona: Hm\\nPersona: I do mass cooking every week, but I dont freeze stuff\\nPersona: Shopping wise, hm perhaps I could try online\\nPersona: maybe I should also try freezing\\nPersona: Overall I feel like there is a lot in common that we do regarding this whole productivity theory\\nFriend: I see them as something to \u201eget rid of\u201d xd Assignments are related to what we had on the lectures/classes. Doing the them helps me understand the most important concepts and I don\u2019t have to study that much later on.\\nFriend: As I said, my \u201ctechniques\u201d are no rocket science but it took me some time to build and adapt this mindset\\nFriend: Yeah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m only eating frozen meals but the thing is that I don\u2019t have to cook if I don\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s why I also mentioned having ingredients for all of the basic and quick meals.\nFor me it\u2019s mainly oatmeal, pasta and miso soup. I can make these in around 15min so I don\u2019t consider it as \u201ccooking\u201d\\nFriend: Oh and also, with my lifestyle it\u2019s very inconvenient to do it differently. As I have a few projects going on, there\u2019s more important and fun stuff to worry about than throwing all nighters to do some assignments ;) that\u2019s the engine for my will power\\nPersona: a nice danish song\\nPersona: with english part\\nPersona: ugh, yeah, but they are usuallly at low urgency after they get assigned\\nPersona: I stopped eating oatmeal rn. I got too bored finally\\nFriend: I\u2019m preparing for a hybrid way of living that I wish to have. Soo being able to work and study anywhere anytime? Check. Having (almost) no fresh produce in the fridge? Check. Minimising the amount of stuff that I own? Check.\n\nHaving all that brings me lots of convenience and peace\\nPersona: true, the goal of this semester for now is to not have any allnighters\\nPersona: its the bane of my will to live\\nFriend: So be the one who creates that urgency. Treat yourself with doing more important things after you get rid of those\\nPersona: that is a nice setup\\nFriend: I have classes only on some of the weekends so usually I start working on notes and assignments in the evenings during the weekend or on the first few days after that(for bigger assignments). Is it tiring? Yes. But does it pay off? Very much\\nFriend: Omg I looove danish disco\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: But, she pretty youthful\\nPersona: oh wait wife meterial? yeah\\nPersona: Definetely\\nFriend: :DDD what\\nPersona: idk what I thought\\nFriend: what did you think before\\nFriend: lol\\nFriend: i wanna be like her\n\nI wanna figure out husband material vibes and give them\\nPersona: I thouhht smth along the lines of doing wifes job around the house without a relatiomship, just housewife xded\\nFriend: its like super human stuff i feel like\\nFriend: she is pretty cool lik you say\nmusic and taste and fun\\nPersona: You seemed handy and husband meterial\\nFriend: not stiff\\nPersona: you guys should cook together\\nPersona: she mentioned smth like, you cooked similar\\nPersona: yeah, I approve ppl by music and she def approved\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: Airidas Seal Of Approval\\nPersona: Invite her for cooking\\nFriend: like make christmas dinner for more ppl or 1-1\\nPersona: christmas dinner?\\nFriend: would be fun to have a gathering home with her\nshe can be good part of group\\nPersona: Do it soon, this week maybe, just you too cooking dinner or/and maybe meal prep?\\nPersona: just you and her, casual household dinner cooking or meal prep\\nPersona: Nothing too special\\nPersona: Fun, useful activity, that both of you are into\\nFriend: let's see\\nFriend: thanks for today tho :D was nice dj-ing me\\nFriend: and sunset and almost crash\\nFriend: fun going ikea again xD\\nPersona: yh that scary xd\\nPersona: alright, imma go sleep\\nFriend: we fuck hard :D\\nFriend: wait thats third meaning..\\nFriend: sleep tight!\\nPersona: tnks, you too!\\nFriend: yo how much did it cost you to get another lid form IKEA\\nPersona: not much, dont worry about it :D\\nPersona: Better tell me how much do I pay for the car?\\nFriend: take the lid out of car cost maybe then\\nFriend: it's a 70 a person\n\nbut check this out\\nFriend: 150 discount for november \n59 insurance\\nFriend: so 6 hours = 278 :D\\nPersona: CHEEEAP\\nPersona: you paid for that in good pasta \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: bro that chair\\nPersona: worth every penny\\nPersona: I feel like in heaven\\nFriend: black got red! :o nice\\nPersona: I am not a fan of chair colors, but its very minimal and out of all hue colors red most fits my room"

Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nFriend: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nPersona: I'll show you next time we meet\\nPersona: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nPersona: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow.

But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nPersona: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nPersona: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nPersona: lets check if other have office hours\\nPersona: Rob also has on Monday...\\nPersona: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Will check on next gas station\\nPersona: what trip are you having?\\nPersona: sorry for my slow response I am nolifing\\nFriend: Summerhouse with Laura and her mom\\nFriend: Near Esbjerg\\nPersona: I am playing rimworld with her\\nPersona: and she is talking too much about real life\\nPersona: its soo boring\\nPersona: hows summer house trip?\\nPersona: playing rimworld for 500hrs is worth it just for understanding r/rimworld\\nPersona: bruh I spent 30 mins at work thinking how to name two variables.\\nPersona: Bruh I have never seen this before.

I also have high chances of getting free stay.\\nPersona: Thats exatccly what I did in Poland, but before making this I didn't realize I have similar situation in netherlands\\nPersona: Also I had no clue I know so many Romanians, but none of them currently live there, so if I want to visit Romania, I have to wait until the expats mature and get send back to Romania.\\nPersona: You know what would be psychopath level weird?\\nPersona: Image you are Polish and you just met me. You tell me you are Polish. I say \"Oh nice, you are the 19th polish person I know\"\\nPersona: I was reading a theory for an exam and despite the theory I found an interesting example here\\nPersona: I think exactly the same regarding academic papers that are paid.

Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice photo\\nPersona: real talk\\nPersona: :DDD\\nFriend: You missed a video chat with Patryk.\\nPersona: wait I am still reading\\nPersona: but okay\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nFriend: I have great material for your handy craft\\nPersona: beautiful video\\nPersona: magical\\nPersona: divine\\nFriend: <3\\nFriend: How do you spend your Saturday?

Already had a few small accomplishments and working on some more stuff.\\nFriend: I think I finally learned how to better manage my time and work so it helps a lot. I\u2019ve been trying to find the right system since November and it feels like I got this now. So even though I have more projects, there\u2019s almost no stress.\\nPersona: kind of. I will most likely be paid more than most of the rest of students.

Doing the them helps me understand the most important concepts and I don\u2019t have to study that much later on.\\nFriend: As I said, my \u201ctechniques\u201d are no rocket science but it took me some time to build and adapt this mindset\\nFriend: Yeah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m only eating frozen meals but the thing is that I don\u2019t have to cook if I don\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s why I also mentioned having ingredients for all of the basic and quick meals.\nFor me it\u2019s mainly oatmeal, pasta and miso soup. I can make these in around 15min so I don\u2019t consider it as \u201ccooking\u201d\\nFriend: Oh and also, with my lifestyle it\u2019s very inconvenient to do it differently. As I have a few projects going on, there\u2019s more important and fun stuff to worry about than throwing all nighters to do some assignments ;) that\u2019s the engine for my will power\\nPersona: a nice danish song\\nPersona: with english part\\nPersona: ugh, yeah, but they are usuallly at low urgency after they get assigned\\nPersona: I stopped eating oatmeal rn. I got too bored finally\\nFriend: I\u2019m preparing for a hybrid way of living that I wish to have. Soo being able to work and study anywhere anytime? Check. Having (almost) no fresh produce in the fridge? Check. Minimising the amount of stuff that I own? Check.\n\nHaving all that brings me lots of convenience and peace\\nPersona: true, the goal of this semester for now is to not have any allnighters\\nPersona: its the bane of my will to live\\nFriend: So be the one who creates that urgency. Treat yourself with doing more important things after you get rid of those\\nPersona: that is a nice setup\\nFriend: I have classes only on some of the weekends so usually I start working on notes and assignments in the evenings during the weekend or on the first few days after that(for bigger assignments). Is it tiring? Yes. But does it pay off? Very much\\nFriend: Omg I looove danish disco\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in revolut\\nFriend: See if that notif\\nPersona: and when you get salary\\nPersona: do you get notif?\\nPersona: fack I forgot avocados\\nPersona: in lidl\\nFriend: Want?\nI'll go home now\\nFriend: Can do delivery in 1 hr\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Thanks man, no need to bother\\nPersona: was just a random rhetorical complaint\\nFriend: I need to go buy something rn\nTest notifications\\nFriend: Avocados was good reason\\nPersona: you will test it somewhere regardless \ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: 20 sec after\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: Holy shit she is OP\\nPersona: Founder/Team Lead/Entrepreneur\nFull stack dev\nAI data scientist\\nPersona: My Entrepreneuship lecturer made an interview with her, if interested lmk, I can send you dl link\\nFriend: yeah\nhit me up\\nFriend: good radio while doing stuff\\nPersona: (of course - she looks pretty ugly, but that's expected from lady with such skill categories)\\nPersona: She has some good content.

Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade.

Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish.

Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice photo\\nPersona: real talk\\nPersona: :DDD\\nFriend: You missed a video chat with Patryk.\\nPersona: wait I am still reading\\nPersona: but okay\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nFriend: I have great material for your handy craft\\nPersona: beautiful video\\nPersona: magical\\nPersona: divine\\nFriend: <3\\nFriend: How do you spend your Saturday?

Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\\nFriend: really? why?\\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\\nPersona: I left it multiple times, too drunk to drive home haha\\nFriend: but why do you know them i mean hahaha\\nFriend: oh\\nFriend: okay thanks!\\nPersona: I guess for everyone of them its a different story ahaha\\nPersona: Some are colleagues, some friends, some that I met on some event\\nFriend: i\u2019m kind of scared\\nFriend: i am counting on you to help me now hah\\nPersona: I will help where I can <3\\nPersona: Did you end up applying to it as 1st prio?\\nFriend: yes \ud83d\ude2c\\nFriend: idk i think the classes are something that actually interests me where ones from my second options were more boring and basic\\nFriend: i just wanted it bc it\u2019s seemed more easy for me\\nPersona: DB is nice, I would probably have put it higher in priorities too, but I applied for DTU course first\\nPersona: What was the other one you were considering?\\nFriend: managing innovation and business development\\nPersona: Thats a good one tho\\nFriend: it had CF so at least i don\u2019t have to do that shot again\\nFriend: it is good\\nPersona: I applied as my first prio at CBS to this\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: nice\\nFriend: Example of the things we did\\nPersona: check your msg requests, I made a group with you and her\\nPersona: or maybe just pm her, honestly idk why I made the group lol\\nFriend: Haha yes yes, thank you!!!!!\\nFriend: hey whats up, the Friday bar thing is today?\\nPersona: hey, I forgot about it totally. even I got it marked haha.

So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\\nFriend: and we measure the difference\\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\\nFriend: who said that's desired?\\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\\nFriend: well, was worth a try \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\\nPersona: that is a cool way. Cant you also be your own study subject? I will randomize the piwko for you\\nPersona: the its n=2\\nPersona: But why not? I want both fancy, what do you mean?\\nPersona: Our language is oldest european, so they stole from us \ud83e\udd78\\nPersona: that is true\\nPersona: somehow\\nPersona: I remember back in highschool I had the desperate friends, with whom I drank sometimes and they were really seeking for tips how to get drunk cheapest. Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society\\nPersona: You know these magical tilted, or inversed rooms, where things are glue to the ground and the the room is tilted, so it looks like normal one, but when you walk on semingly flat ground, you are going on a strong incline? Maybe that could be a great start\\nFriend: that's unethical. as you can see, I care about ethics very much\\nFriend: oh, are you? that means that we evolve in the direction of fewer fancy letters over time. now that's sad. keep your fancy letters the\\nFriend: then*\\nFriend: oh yeah I was that person. tough we used to drink the legendary sulfur-loaded wine Amarena in old bunkers instead of going to school. I bet every dumb thing I've done in my life can be traced back to brain damage induced by that luxury beverage\\nFriend: it's like 7-8kr per bottle\\nFriend: and we also call the moonshine samogon (or more commonly bomber), though it was more of an 80s thing\\nFriend: keep in mind that during my experiments I need to maintain low social battery, so everyone pisses me off. no one's safe\\nFriend: are you sponsored by some straw company? I'm getting suspicious\\nFriend: excellent. everything is going as planned\\nFriend: yeah, it crossed my mind as well, but then your feet are still on the ground so it's not perfect. we need a chair\\nFriend: I also considered shooting people into space or sending them on a weightless flight, but I'm not sure how I feel about that yet\\nFriend: bimber* not bomber \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: some of them are of very very trivial utility I think, while being a super common typo and mistake source\\nPersona: like there should be no \u0105, just a.\\nPersona: Or no \u0173, just u and \u016b is enough\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish.

I used to put 10% of income there, but not thats filled up I have them free to put somewhere else\\nPersona: I currently distribute 10% for financial/investment saving\\nFriend: so instead of safety jar --> financial investments?\\nFriend: the mentor at cbs recommended for us to build a \"fuck off\" jar :DD\nexactly a savings one\n\nthat would allow you to say \"no\" to your boss when you get asked something you dont want to do (for moral or whatever reasons)\\nFriend: but yeah\nsafety net first, and then go wild\\nFriend: cause some of your money still goes on to build safety net. Just a less liquid one (if its some investments)\\nPersona: Yeah, thats actually the most effective reason behind by 'safety' jar - the fuck-off ability. The safety jar is hard cold cash, uninvested, so accessible anytime, but I guess any highly liquid money (whcih includes most of securities and partly my P2P loans) brings you the fuck-off ability. \nI my 'secure' account I now have 15 000 DKK, which is enough for two months neccesities, but in case shit happens and lasts more than 2 months, thats enough time to liquidify many investments, so there is no reason to keep more than 15 000 for sure. I was debating whether it is worth it to even keep 15 000 totally unemployed, but maybe thats good, cause it gives the best fuck-off effect. Its a pain if saying no to your boss costs you the mental damage of damaging your golden egg chicken, so I will keep the 15 000 DKK in cash.\\nPersona: yeah exactly\\nFriend: nice :D\\nFriend: 15 k sounds low to me but because i once went from 60 to 20k and i dont spend enough effort \n\ndepends on you whats a good buffer\\nPersona: With compound interest and adding 10% monthly, assuming 19% yearly interest, 2.3% inflation, I would reach my current level financial freedom (12 000 DKK monthly just from interest) in 15 years.\\nPersona: from 60 to 20 in how long?\\nFriend: few months ofc\\nPersona: The 15K is just in cash, the other buffer are liquid investments, so the buffer is much more than 2 months, when investments are liquified. Do you see reason in keeping more than 2 months of neccesities in cash?\\nFriend: if you have highly liquid investment, no\\nFriend: but in my case its just gamestop.. if it goes 0 then yeah\\nFriend: i need more than 15k\\nFriend: your case less risky with different people loaning money on p2p fex\\nPersona: Hm. I would say there is a difference between liquid and risky. You have liquid money, but risky\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Im feeling funny\\nFriend: Not sure if its the excitement or caffeine hit\\nPersona: did you drink a lot of coffeine?\\nFriend: Had a big big coffee\\nFriend: With lots of caramel syrup\\nFriend: I feel like a 3 year old\\nPersona: sounds exciting\\nFriend: Could run around in circles\\nFriend: And everything is funny xd\\nPersona: Big big excitement\\nPersona: thats good\\nFriend: Or maybe its the drugs\\nPersona: cause I am also in stupid mode\\nFriend: I dont have to meet with Marta\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Getting ready for the takeoff\\nFriend: Seee youu\\nFriend: Im hungry :<\\nPersona: See you \ud83e\udd70\\nPersona: Let me know when you are close to the exit, I will drive closer\\nFriend: Coucou\\nFriend: Just landed\\nPersona: Alright, let me know ~10 mins before you exit the airport\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: I will come here\\nFriend: Captain himself apologised for the delay \ud83d\udc7a\\nFriend: Oki\\nPersona: no worries\\nFriend: Almost out\\nPersona: ok the parking is under repair\\nFriend: Aphrodite \ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f called you.\\nFriend: Aphrodite \ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f called you.\\nFriend: My perception of you\\nPersona: the work at work\\nFriend: Hahah how cute\\nFriend: I should\u2019ve taken my julebryg outfit\\nPersona: you still have time to buy a hat hehe\\nPersona: or two\\nFriend: I\u2019m going out soon, will be near your office .

Or even have negative effect on capital.\\nPersona: We no longer need reproduction for fitness growth, thus we may be able to have fitness growth without death as we can get rid of overpopulation by not reproducing (or reproducing at a rate = increase in carbon energy generation capacity)\\nPersona: But young people may however have higher contributions to capital though, due to neuroplasticity. So death may still be optimal.\\nPersona: lol I should stop\\nPersona: I wrote a whole essay here\\nFriend: Fitness setting (current gene) iskinda like knowledge but different\n\nCapital too\\nPersona: I dont get what you mean\\nPersona: Idk bro, I keep changing my opinions\\nPersona: maybe fitness is no longer survival rn\\nPersona: There might be no generally aplicable abstract truth.We are just pieces of predetermined matter in motion\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude16\\nFriend: i think fitness still survival\\nFriend: but we are able to use something more than evolutionary reaction and randomness to survival\\nPersona: what is evolutionary r\u0119action?\\nFriend: cause\\nFriend: the tool for survival of things\\nFriend: is \"make as many of us as possible\"\\nFriend: and let randomness decide whats good\\nPersona: Yeah thats one iteration\\nPersona: Then the dominant one gets to replicate most\\nFriend: but with societal structures and knowledge it changes a bit\\nFriend: and its more like which society is better kind of\\nFriend: but I feel like we can't afford at this stage to let things run it's course and \"test\"\n\nyou either make it or die\n\nlike with things coming into the far future like inevitable sun death \n\nor maybe meteor hitting earth\\nPersona: Genetica I think became almost irrelevant.

I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\\nPersona: give me a sec\\nPersona: some ideas\\nPersona: topics rather\\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world.

Sometimes you are well conscise, but some sentences are bloated with sophisticated words that tell nothing. You are talking to IT, innovation people - they value consciseness. Especially the introduction and ending are written in a very different style from the rest of the text.\n\nAlso do some proofreading to try to improve the sentence structure and flow (perhaps a evening read with Kaja could work?), choose a consistency with capitalization.\n\nIn some sentences, you don't appear fully commited, I marked those. I think you should leave no doubts.\\nPersona: it didn't work for me to leave comments in your doc\\nPersona: so I made a copy\\nFriend: Do I talk to IT people?

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nPersona: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nPersona: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nPersona: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nPersona: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nPersona: all the time\\nPersona: this time the most\\nPersona: out of all\\nPersona: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nPersona: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nPersona: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nFriend: Will do now\\nFriend: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nFriend: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nFriend: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nFriend: What is that 1 called?\\nFriend: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nFriend: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nFriend: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nPersona: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nPersona: see*\\nFriend: Don't stress it.

Good or bad. Depends how things go\n\nIf I slack a lot and game a lot f.ex. or if I work a lot\\nFriend: ah I think you showed me that one time :D that was cool\\nPersona: having a gf you meanM\\nPersona: ?*\\nPersona: You wanted that though, plus its a normal thing, productive people learn to manage lives with girlfriends\\nFriend: yea\\nPersona: How much do you like her?\\nPersona: everything into account\\nFriend: like gf or normal?\nbecause normal, I think she can be someone important in life\ngf, I'm not sure what to think\\nFriend: She reminds me of someone I lost friendship with. And that messes with my perception\\nPersona: So like gf, you are not sure\\nPersona: And as a friend (normal), she is nice?\\nPersona: Its a weird case, does that bothet you a lot?\\nPersona: If thats the only problem for gf, then maybe see if this messing with your perception goes away\\nFriend: don't think i can stop my head from remembering the other person soon\n\nThink I need more social confirmation and if others like her, then I'd trust that more than myself\\nFriend: feeling stupid \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: Okay get that social confirmation. I think she has a pretty likeable personality, she seems honest. Looks wise she is not the hottest chick, but in terms of intelligence its a rare find.\\nPersona: from my point of view\\nFriend: social confirmation received\\nPersona: well you should get more\\nPersona: if you want to trust it more than yourself\\nFriend: I'm having huge confirmation bias now because I see it the same way\\nFriend: don't know a girl that I can get an opinion from that I can trust with taht\\nPersona: Maybe because we see women in similar way.

If a loan has a rate like 25%+, even if the person is asking for 5% premium, I could buy it and then it would become a 20% loan for me, but with lower risk, as the person was already paying on time for a while\\nPersona: I think I got a history of 400+ loans, I been looking forward to doing some analysis to actually find strategies to optimize this\\nPersona: baught 2 like those right noe\\nPersona: now*\\nPersona: will check sometimes, and then see\\nFriend: uuu and the research was on danish market or european? there can be some cultural differencies which can impact the risk\\nFriend: or even economic state, like now we are close to recession so that can also make an impact\\nPersona: I dont remember\\nPersona: when I see it again I can tell you\\nPersona: I need to look into how loans respond to economic downturns\\nPersona: during corona it was chill\\nPersona: are you conspirint about smth big it a normal cycle recession?\\nPersona: europe just has a recession\\nPersona: Why do you think a recession is coming?\\nPersona: maybe because of inflation\\nFriend: because we increasing our intrest rates and that almost always outcomes in recession\\nFriend: as investment decreases\\nFriend: gdp decreases too\\nFriend: so that's also a risk for you as the loans you give also get a 5% central bank intrest rate\\nFriend: and if people/companies are arleady in debt then this 5% can make a huge differences in their business stability and development\\nFriend: I don't travel with my weed\\nFriend: Xddd\\nPersona: thats for krem\\nPersona: or lubricant, safety cum, etc\\nFriend: Mehhh\\nFriend: Don't travel with that either\\nPersona: L'auberge espagnole\\nFriend: Why you think so\\nPersona: It captures multicultural experience very well\\nFriend: Gonna check it out\\nFriend: Can i watch it on Netflix or Disney?\\nPersona: Not sure\\nFriend: Seeds sucks\\nPersona: Yeah this one sucks, but there is another one on 1337x thats like 1gb or smth\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its possible though that its still.optimal because old brains tend to be less innovative, less explorative and thus contribute less to capital. Or even have negative effect on capital.\\nPersona: We no longer need reproduction for fitness growth, thus we may be able to have fitness growth without death as we can get rid of overpopulation by not reproducing (or reproducing at a rate = increase in carbon energy generation capacity)\\nPersona: But young people may however have higher contributions to capital though, due to neuroplasticity. So death may still be optimal.\\nPersona: lol I should stop\\nPersona: I wrote a whole essay here\\nFriend: Fitness setting (current gene) iskinda like knowledge but different\n\nCapital too\\nPersona: I dont get what you mean\\nPersona: Idk bro, I keep changing my opinions\\nPersona: maybe fitness is no longer survival rn\\nPersona: There might be no generally aplicable abstract truth.We are just pieces of predetermined matter in motion\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude16\\nFriend: i think fitness still survival\\nFriend: but we are able to use something more than evolutionary reaction and randomness to survival\\nPersona: what is evolutionary r\u0119action?\\nFriend: cause\\nFriend: the tool for survival of things\\nFriend: is \"make as many of us as possible\"\\nFriend: and let randomness decide whats good\\nPersona: Yeah thats one iteration\\nPersona: Then the dominant one gets to replicate most\\nFriend: but with societal structures and knowledge it changes a bit\\nFriend: and its more like which society is better kind of\\nFriend: but I feel like we can't afford at this stage to let things run it's course and \"test\"\n\nyou either make it or die\n\nlike with things coming into the far future like inevitable sun death \n\nor maybe meteor hitting earth\\nPersona: Genetica I think became almost irrelevant. Its took billions of years. We just took 4000 years to double peoplea life expectancy\\nPersona: Using capital\\nPersona: I lost you there\\nPersona: Testing with death as an answer is no longer relevant\\nPersona: mutations are slow and take thousands of yearz\\nFriend: as in, now it's less evolution on the human level\n\nit's more on the structure that humans are\\nFriend: like a humans evolution is less about the evolution of it's cells\n\nit's more about the evolution of the environment and system that sets up those cells\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: so humans maybe are more irrelevant in the big picture and a big organism made of humans is forming\\nPersona: Agree\\nPersona: But what is the meaning of one concious indicidual then?\\nFriend: but depending on the perspective you could argue there aren't many organisms of humans\n\nlike currently there are. Countries and what not\nand you have some thriving better\n\nbut interstellar wise its just 1 colony\\nFriend: and if its just 1 organism\n\nand it dies\n\ngame over\\nPersona: yeah maybe its smth bigger\\nPersona: But our progress is a bit isolates though\\nPersona: rn its only on earth pretty much ( well technically our solar system maybe )\\nPersona: we were optimized there in isolation\\nPersona: we are not yet competing with anyone else\\nFriend: yeah\nits more relevant to \"the creation of the first organism\"\\nFriend: how tf did the first one survive\\nFriend: it probably didnt\\nPersona: it didnt until a random arrangement allowed it to replicate\\nPersona: probably\\nFriend: holy fuck xD the first ever organism and you are sitting there like \"wtf. Where is my splitting ability\"\\nFriend: soo uh yeah.. hoomans are probably doomed but maybe not\\nPersona: Even if that organism could survive, if it coulnd replicate, it would.not continue\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: But\\nFriend: No\\nPersona: if they get the one time pass, they wont get an actual pass generator\\nPersona: the pass generator key is like a private key thats never sent\\nFriend: Maybe they will\nIf they get your session cookie or something\\nFriend: And if they can refresh it\\nPersona: (of course if its http, then session cookie is risk)\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: yeah thats true\\nFriend: Unless site kicks you out even after active time\\nPersona: yeah I guess you can esily get hacked on http, that was too large of an assumption haha\\nFriend: XD\nThey wont steal your phone and the 2nd factor\\nPersona: but you get the point. Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: my hilarious story was a lie\\nPersona: but it was funny while it lastdd\\nFriend: gotta remember to bring you spaker and keys tomorrow\\nPersona: ye would be nice\\nPersona: is 12:00 fine for you?\\nPersona: Yo, so u guys coming at 12?\\nFriend: Just finished breakfast \nIm ready for 12\\nFriend: Erkan says he late 20 min\\nPersona: I met a pretty hot chick from ITU yesterday\\nPersona: like 9/10\\nPersona: she said she likes coding, she coded some arduino bear for autistic children\\nPersona: but as I keep asking more she was so fucking off, like she knew so little about coding\\nPersona: she kept saying thay c++ is the best prototyping language\\nPersona: its always like that, beauty and coding dont go well together\\nFriend: C++ can be good for prototyping if you are into some hardcore stuff\\nFriend: Was she really good or is she really bad\\nPersona: but generally it would be too costly to make prototypes in c++\\nPersona: c++ is fasf when you deploy it\\nPersona: if want to code smth fast python is good test out some concept\\nPersona: unless its embedded stuff and you have low power\\nPersona: idk that was one example\\nPersona: but she gave me very shallow vibes\\nFriend: Would you do movie night during the week\\nFriend: We can try monday tuesday\\nPersona: yeah I am down\\nPersona: holiday from work\\nPersona: I put \ud83c\udf34 on my slack\\nFriend: Ok quick nap for me\nIll wake up in 40 min and see if Erkan on the way\\nPersona: btw if you want to do some business development representing (BDR) at TwentyThree, let my know, they are hiring like 8 new ones in August-September and they have fuckup hiring policy, they dont post ads, most come from connections I feel\\nFriend: we on the way soon\\nFriend: what does a bdr does\\nFriend: is it like marketing\\nFriend: we can maybe talk when we exercis\\nFriend: There in 5\\nFriend: Here\\nFriend: Tomorrow 22+ movie night\\nFriend: Good?\\nPersona: good\\nPersona: Lauras place?\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nPersona: alright\\nPersona: After the road trip, car dashboard got 3 new emojis\\nPersona: doing some research wtf to do\\nFriend: Damn.. what are they?

I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\\nPersona: give me a sec\\nPersona: some ideas\\nPersona: topics rather\\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do.

I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: and yeh, in the area of what I was thinking\\nPersona: Its just incredible how they collaborated with DoorDash for pick up\\nPersona: Startups like these inspire me a lot\\nPersona: We should do something crazy cool. Like bold, brave and public.\\nPersona: My old ex friend did a travetron\\nPersona: crazy dude he is, we used to do craziest shit\\nPersona: traveltron is when you stream you travel, and get donations to travel more\\nPersona: but you have to become an interesting persona and people pay cause they make you do stuff, can influence where you go\\nPersona: and while you can hardly cheat interesting, but what many people don't have is the balls to do crazy shit\\nPersona: I wonder if its possible to pull smth off like this during summer\\nFriend: Hmmmm travelton you say? Never heard about it\\nFriend: Could be hard to keep low attention spam beings to keep watching us, we would have to do crazy shit the whole time\\nFriend: Xd\\nFriend: But overall I'm always up for crazy shit so whenever I'm back in DK we can do some jackass staff xd\\nFriend: hi bro\\nPersona: Hi bro\\nPersona: Will look\\nFriend: thanks bro\\nPersona: Try to be more conscise and less generic. Sometimes you are well conscise, but some sentences are bloated with sophisticated words that tell nothing. You are talking to IT, innovation people - they value consciseness. Especially the introduction and ending are written in a very different style from the rest of the text.\n\nAlso do some proofreading to try to improve the sentence structure and flow (perhaps a evening read with Kaja could work?), choose a consistency with capitalization.\n\nIn some sentences, you don't appear fully commited, I marked those. I think you should leave no doubts.\\nPersona: it didn't work for me to leave comments in your doc\\nPersona: so I made a copy\\nFriend: Do I talk to IT people? I thought it's readed by admission people who doesn't know much about IT and they just try to find some key words xd\\nPersona: Hm. Not 100% sure, but it would make sense that it is read by the head of studeis\\nPersona: studies*\\nPersona: or by people in that field at least\\nPersona: But not sure\\nFriend: yeah but those uncomitted were about BEIT, I think I show the comitment about IS\\nPersona: It would be stupid if an application a subject is evaluated by people who have no understanding in the subject\\nFriend: that's how most of the HR works xdd\\nFriend: Thanks man it helps a lot, your feedback is as always profound and on place ;*\\nFriend: on point*\\nPersona: no problem man\\nPersona: We will make it to our dream progams <3\\nFriend: we will  <3\\nFriend: do you apply only at DTU?\\nPersona: DTU first choice\\nPersona: then CBS if it does not workout\\nFriend: what you apply for?\\nPersona: Technology Entrepreneurship\\nFriend: alright all in entrepreneurship\\nFriend: you won't regret it\\nFriend: Can't wait to see your first product live ;*\\nFriend: or maybe I should say your first baby <3\\nPersona: xdddd\\nPersona: lets not call startups babies\\nPersona: I have to make sure I make it in to the program\\nPersona: I will try hard\\nPersona: I already met the head of studies\\nPersona: talked with her\\nFriend: you will, I don't think that there is much applicants with background like yours\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The tree grows and your house becomes a tree house\\nFriend: When I hear bing chilling I associate it with you\\nPersona: xddd nice\\nPersona: My two electives overlap\\nPersona: have to drop one\\nPersona: either Systems analysis and design or Startup law\\nPersona: Systems A&D teacher is a woman\\nPersona: I pulled off a swichbus manouver. 2A  was so full, like hard to brathe, superhot.

Excel opened like 20 tabs of this link. Removing the link also for reason clear the formatting, which is unrelated.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nPersona: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nPersona: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nPersona: all the time\\nPersona: this time the most\\nPersona: out of all\\nPersona: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nPersona: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nPersona: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nFriend: Will do now\\nFriend: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nFriend: Amazing!

Got to know your roomie better?\\nFriend: actually did a little ye\nwas a nice start to our cohabiting life :D\\nFriend: i knew some stuff from before \ncause she seems very active at home\n\nI was going out\n\nand she just takes the initiative to arrange things and make it nice\\nPersona: yeah good stuff, seems you were both into bringing more life and action into your household\\nFriend: like good wife material vibes\\nPersona: xdddddd\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: she nice too\\nFriend: yeah? you see it too?\\nPersona: XDDD\\nPersona: nah not too much\\nPersona: Well in a way yes\\nFriend: xD ok must be just my imagination\\nPersona: But, she pretty youthful\\nPersona: oh wait wife meterial? yeah\\nPersona: Definetely\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\\nPersona: I can be your test rat\\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\\nFriend: and we measure the difference\\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\\nFriend: who said that's desired?\\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\\nFriend: well, was worth a try \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\\nPersona: that is a cool way. Cant you also be your own study subject? I will randomize the piwko for you\\nPersona: the its n=2\\nPersona: But why not? I want both fancy, what do you mean?\\nPersona: Our language is oldest european, so they stole from us \ud83e\udd78\\nPersona: that is true\\nPersona: somehow\\nPersona: I remember back in highschool I had the desperate friends, with whom I drank sometimes and they were really seeking for tips how to get drunk cheapest. Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society\\nPersona: You know these magical tilted, or inversed rooms, where things are glue to the ground and the the room is tilted, so it looks like normal one, but when you walk on semingly flat ground, you are going on a strong incline? Maybe that could be a great start\\nFriend: that's unethical. as you can see, I care about ethics very much\\nFriend: oh, are you? that means that we evolve in the direction of fewer fancy letters over time. now that's sad. keep your fancy letters the\\nFriend: then*\\nFriend: oh yeah I was that person. tough we used to drink the legendary sulfur-loaded wine Amarena in old bunkers instead of going to school. I bet every dumb thing I've done in my life can be traced back to brain damage induced by that luxury beverage\\nFriend: it's like 7-8kr per bottle\\nFriend: and we also call the moonshine samogon (or more commonly bomber), though it was more of an 80s thing\\nFriend: keep in mind that during my experiments I need to maintain low social battery, so everyone pisses me off. no one's safe\\nFriend: are you sponsored by some straw company? I'm getting suspicious\\nFriend: excellent. everything is going as planned\\nFriend: yeah, it crossed my mind as well, but then your feet are still on the ground so it's not perfect. we need a chair\\nFriend: I also considered shooting people into space or sending them on a weightless flight, but I'm not sure how I feel about that yet\\nFriend: bimber* not bomber \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: some of them are of very very trivial utility I think, while being a super common typo and mistake source\\nPersona: like there should be no \u0105, just a.\\nPersona: Or no \u0173, just u and \u016b is enough\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ah\\nPersona: I will try opening it today\\nPersona: in a 15 mins\\nPersona: there is also this\\nFriend: the TV? :D\\nFriend: looks a bit small on the pic but it's better than a laptop monitor\\nPersona: ok cinema works\\nPersona: like I can get it\\nPersona: should I book?\\nFriend: yeah if its good, lets take it\\nPersona: Alright\\nFriend: what time do we have the cinema for\\nPersona: booked 18:00 - 21:30\\nPersona: but the booking are rare, so we should be able to stay more \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: have you seen Tobys gf?\\nPersona: just curious\\nFriend: Ye pics\\nFriend: He maxxed out\\nFriend: We were at her workplace but not on one of her tables so didn't get to see her much irl\\nFriend: Patrik inv too to movie>?\\nPersona: what does that mean?\\nPersona: When you did yday, didnt he say he was working?\\nPersona: My classmate got this published xdd\\nPersona: go to KEA, hate KEA, go to CBS, hate CBS\\nPersona: fuck I just spent 2,5hra chilling at the couch\\nFriend: i was listening to a brief of book\\nFriend: there is value in resting too\\nFriend: depends\\nPersona: yeah, thats what science says\\nPersona: but idk, I could have just gone to sleep\\nPersona: Yo, I kept thinking about what you said with not worth saving while studying\\nPersona: Right now making some personal finane decison, as next month I am hitting my goal for my 'secure' jar where I keep solid cash in case bad shit happens. I used to put 10% of income there, but not thats filled up I have them free to put somewhere else\\nPersona: I currently distribute 10% for financial/investment saving\\nFriend: so instead of safety jar --> financial investments?\\nFriend: the mentor at cbs recommended for us to build a \"fuck off\" jar :DD\nexactly a savings one\n\nthat would allow you to say \"no\" to your boss when you get asked something you dont want to do (for moral or whatever reasons)\\nFriend: but yeah\nsafety net first, and then go wild\\nFriend: cause some of your money still goes on to build safety net. Just a less liquid one (if its some investments)\\nPersona: Yeah, thats actually the most effective reason behind by 'safety' jar - the fuck-off ability. The safety jar is hard cold cash, uninvested, so accessible anytime, but I guess any highly liquid money (whcih includes most of securities and partly my P2P loans) brings you the fuck-off ability. \nI my 'secure' account I now have 15 000 DKK, which is enough for two months neccesities, but in case shit happens and lasts more than 2 months, thats enough time to liquidify many investments, so there is no reason to keep more than 15 000 for sure. I was debating whether it is worth it to even keep 15 000 totally unemployed, but maybe thats good, cause it gives the best fuck-off effect. Its a pain if saying no to your boss costs you the mental damage of damaging your golden egg chicken, so I will keep the 15 000 DKK in cash.\\nPersona: yeah exactly\\nFriend: nice :D\\nFriend: 15 k sounds low to me but because i once went from 60 to 20k and i dont spend enough effort \n\ndepends on you whats a good buffer\\nPersona: With compound interest and adding 10% monthly, assuming 19% yearly interest, 2.3% inflation, I would reach my current level financial freedom (12 000 DKK monthly just from interest) in 15 years.\\nPersona: from 60 to 20 in how long?\\nFriend: few months ofc\\nPersona: The 15K is just in cash, the other buffer are liquid investments, so the buffer is much more than 2 months, when investments are liquified. Do you see reason in keeping more than 2 months of neccesities in cash?\\nFriend: if you have highly liquid investment, no\\nFriend: but in my case its just gamestop.. if it goes 0 then yeah\\nFriend: i need more than 15k\\nFriend: your case less risky with different people loaning money on p2p fex\\nPersona: Hm. I would say there is a difference between liquid and risky. You have liquid money, but risky\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its possible though that its still.optimal because old brains tend to be less innovative, less explorative and thus contribute less to capital. Or even have negative effect on capital.\\nPersona: We no longer need reproduction for fitness growth, thus we may be able to have fitness growth without death as we can get rid of overpopulation by not reproducing (or reproducing at a rate = increase in carbon energy generation capacity)\\nPersona: But young people may however have higher contributions to capital though, due to neuroplasticity. So death may still be optimal.\\nPersona: lol I should stop\\nPersona: I wrote a whole essay here\\nFriend: Fitness setting (current gene) iskinda like knowledge but different\n\nCapital too\\nPersona: I dont get what you mean\\nPersona: Idk bro, I keep changing my opinions\\nPersona: maybe fitness is no longer survival rn\\nPersona: There might be no generally aplicable abstract truth.We are just pieces of predetermined matter in motion\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude16\\nFriend: i think fitness still survival\\nFriend: but we are able to use something more than evolutionary reaction and randomness to survival\\nPersona: what is evolutionary r\u0119action?\\nFriend: cause\\nFriend: the tool for survival of things\\nFriend: is \"make as many of us as possible\"\\nFriend: and let randomness decide whats good\\nPersona: Yeah thats one iteration\\nPersona: Then the dominant one gets to replicate most\\nFriend: but with societal structures and knowledge it changes a bit\\nFriend: and its more like which society is better kind of\\nFriend: but I feel like we can't afford at this stage to let things run it's course and \"test\"\n\nyou either make it or die\n\nlike with things coming into the far future like inevitable sun death \n\nor maybe meteor hitting earth\\nPersona: Genetica I think became almost irrelevant. Its took billions of years. We just took 4000 years to double peoplea life expectancy\\nPersona: Using capital\\nPersona: I lost you there\\nPersona: Testing with death as an answer is no longer relevant\\nPersona: mutations are slow and take thousands of yearz\\nFriend: as in, now it's less evolution on the human level\n\nit's more on the structure that humans are\\nFriend: like a humans evolution is less about the evolution of it's cells\n\nit's more about the evolution of the environment and system that sets up those cells\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: so humans maybe are more irrelevant in the big picture and a big organism made of humans is forming\\nPersona: Agree\\nPersona: But what is the meaning of one concious indicidual then?\\nFriend: but depending on the perspective you could argue there aren't many organisms of humans\n\nlike currently there are. Countries and what not\nand you have some thriving better\n\nbut interstellar wise its just 1 colony\\nFriend: and if its just 1 organism\n\nand it dies\n\ngame over\\nPersona: yeah maybe its smth bigger\\nPersona: But our progress is a bit isolates though\\nPersona: rn its only on earth pretty much ( well technically our solar system maybe )\\nPersona: we were optimized there in isolation\\nPersona: we are not yet competing with anyone else\\nFriend: yeah\nits more relevant to \"the creation of the first organism\"\\nFriend: how tf did the first one survive\\nFriend: it probably didnt\\nPersona: it didnt until a random arrangement allowed it to replicate\\nPersona: probably\\nFriend: holy fuck xD the first ever organism and you are sitting there like \"wtf. Where is my splitting ability\"\\nFriend: soo uh yeah.. hoomans are probably doomed but maybe not\\nPersona: Even if that organism could survive, if it coulnd replicate, it would.not continue\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: She declined going out cause it takes time\n\nYou declined writing cause it takes time\n\nSeems ok to me x\\nPersona: noice\\nPersona: nice reasoning\\nFriend: are you around\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: I'mtrying out named functions\\nFriend: pretty cool\\nPersona: really? nice\\nPersona: its funny that I know about them but I never tried\\nFriend: doesn't allow me to use it as a validation rule tho\\nFriend: need to put the formula in a sheet in the same document, \n\nand then use the result as criteria\\nPersona: ahh\\nPersona: does validation allow appscript?\\nPersona: Chloe xdd\\nFriend: My sheet becoming crazy good\\nFriend: you guys inspired me\\nPersona: how is it going with Nathalie? :D\\nFriend: maybe. Haven't tried. Trying to avoid scripting\\nPersona: same, but did some array substituting that needed a scripg today\\nPersona: no convenient workaround for array substitute\\nFriend: Not sure how to think\n\nWould be nice to get a reality check if I should continue to see her\\nFriend: Feel like she fits my mind well\\nFriend: but idk.. also idk if that's good for me\\nFriend: no idea what's array substitute\nstill too far from what you do \ud83d\ude35\\nPersona: its like string substitute but you give a whole array with two columns for which strings to substitute for what\\nPersona: What is concerning you?\\nFriend: that my behaviour would be magnified. Good or bad. Depends how things go\n\nIf I slack a lot and game a lot f.ex. or if I work a lot\\nFriend: ah I think you showed me that one time :D that was cool\\nPersona: having a gf you meanM\\nPersona: ?*\\nPersona: You wanted that though, plus its a normal thing, productive people learn to manage lives with girlfriends\\nFriend: yea\\nPersona: How much do you like her?\\nPersona: everything into account\\nFriend: like gf or normal?\nbecause normal, I think she can be someone important in life\ngf, I'm not sure what to think\\nFriend: She reminds me of someone I lost friendship with. And that messes with my perception\\nPersona: So like gf, you are not sure\\nPersona: And as a friend (normal), she is nice?\\nPersona: Its a weird case, does that bothet you a lot?\\nPersona: If thats the only problem for gf, then maybe see if this messing with your perception goes away\\nFriend: don't think i can stop my head from remembering the other person soon\n\nThink I need more social confirmation and if others like her, then I'd trust that more than myself\\nFriend: feeling stupid \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: Okay get that social confirmation. I think she has a pretty likeable personality, she seems honest. Looks wise she is not the hottest chick, but in terms of intelligence its a rare find.\\nPersona: from my point of view\\nFriend: social confirmation received\\nPersona: well you should get more\\nPersona: if you want to trust it more than yourself\\nFriend: I'm having huge confirmation bias now because I see it the same way\\nFriend: don't know a girl that I can get an opinion from that I can trust with taht\\nPersona: Maybe because we see women in similar way.

Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nFriend: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nPersona: I'll show you next time we meet\\nPersona: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nPersona: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

If a loan has a rate like 25%+, even if the person is asking for 5% premium, I could buy it and then it would become a 20% loan for me, but with lower risk, as the person was already paying on time for a while\\nPersona: I think I got a history of 400+ loans, I been looking forward to doing some analysis to actually find strategies to optimize this\\nPersona: baught 2 like those right noe\\nPersona: now*\\nPersona: will check sometimes, and then see\\nFriend: uuu and the research was on danish market or european? there can be some cultural differencies which can impact the risk\\nFriend: or even economic state, like now we are close to recession so that can also make an impact\\nPersona: I dont remember\\nPersona: when I see it again I can tell you\\nPersona: I need to look into how loans respond to economic downturns\\nPersona: during corona it was chill\\nPersona: are you conspirint about smth big it a normal cycle recession?\\nPersona: europe just has a recession\\nPersona: Why do you think a recession is coming?\\nPersona: maybe because of inflation\\nFriend: because we increasing our intrest rates and that almost always outcomes in recession\\nFriend: as investment decreases\\nFriend: gdp decreases too\\nFriend: so that's also a risk for you as the loans you give also get a 5% central bank intrest rate\\nFriend: and if people/companies are arleady in debt then this 5% can make a huge differences in their business stability and development\\nFriend: I don't travel with my weed\\nFriend: Xddd\\nPersona: thats for krem\\nPersona: or lubricant, safety cum, etc\\nFriend: Mehhh\\nFriend: Don't travel with that either\\nPersona: L'auberge espagnole\\nFriend: Why you think so\\nPersona: It captures multicultural experience very well\\nFriend: Gonna check it out\\nFriend: Can i watch it on Netflix or Disney?\\nPersona: Not sure\\nFriend: Seeds sucks\\nPersona: Yeah this one sucks, but there is another one on 1337x thats like 1gb or smth\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: they dont have\\nFriend: yeah and they have black\\nFriend: i have seen\\nFriend: fuck all\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: lol\\nPersona: I wonder did Lt companies do gay logo.

All LT companies\\nPersona: even most lithuanian company\\nPersona: most of these biggest companies here probably have it.\\nFriend: LT doing good\nDenmark too far from Russia to care\\nPersona: Using windows and mac at the same time is so confusing god damn.

I am using three at the same time\\nPersona: MindManager, Logseq and Obsidian\\nFriend: why both obsidian and log\\nFriend: i can see mindmanager as helper\\nPersona: yeah thats true, thats for legacy reasons and because I trust it for some critical tasks, like exam wiring rn\\nPersona: Because I want to try to both to see which I like more\\nPersona: I use them for multiple topics that hardly intersect\\nPersona: for different*\\nPersona: Logseq so far better suits the functionality and approch I need, but obsidian feels better to use.\\nPersona: Have you been talking to Zoe? Did she.go to SA recently?\\nPersona: I heard they are almost back to pre electricity times there\\nFriend: I don't think recent no\\nFriend: lol\\nFriend: no way\nwhats happening?\\nPersona: Imagine the devastating effect on economy\\nPersona: The power is off half of the day\\nPersona: Everyday\\nPersona: Nationwide\\nFriend: wtf why\\nFriend: saving?\\nPersona: Cause they fucked up with power\\nPersona: Power crisis\\nFriend: oh i talked with a girl recently that went to SA some year ago\n\nthey saved in the hotel the water from showering\\nFriend: to use it to wash other stuff\\nPersona: They even have this app now, which tells at what time will.your household have power\\nFriend: this shit like bulgaria on steroids\nprobably very high difference between richest/poorest\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Try to ask who you want\\nFriend: When you ready ill send her a message too and see how she feels\\nFriend: Havent talked with her sonce last year\\nPersona: alright, I am talking to some ppl rn\\nPersona: what is the location today?\\nFriend: Frederiksberg have\\nFriend: My bike at vanlose\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Maybe we meet somewhere there when we go\\nFriend: Shop beforehand\\nFriend: Fire at 21 45\\nPersona: Okay, i can pick you with a car maybe\\nPersona: when do you finish work?\\nPersona: i parked my car at cbs since yesterday\\nFriend: Any time\nCan go now\\nPersona: I finish maybe 16-17\\nPersona: then it will take me a bit to get to var\\nPersona: car*\\nPersona: will.keep you posted\\nPersona: do you have a link to the event?\\nPersona: I heard this one is good\\nPersona: but maybe yours better\\nFriend: Mm yeah\nIdk i wanna have bike maybe\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Should i come a bit before you finish or we meet near frederiksberg\\nPersona: Amelia is not here anymore I think\\nPersona: when does it start\\nPersona: causr I want to get home first, leave car, drop laptop\\nFriend: Start when we want\\nPersona: Okay, then lets stay in touch\\nPersona: my orther bulgarian friend, borislav is also goong to frderika have actually\\nPersona: you might meet him\\nFriend: Cant hear voice\\nFriend: Forgot headphones home\\nPersona: im omw home\\nPersona: ready to depart from home ~18\\nFriend: Ye\\nFriend: Zoe might not go\\nFriend: A friend said no\\nFriend: Idk about roomie\nNo news\\nFriend: Laura is in\\nFriend: Im omw now\nHave a sitting blanket and regular one\\nPersona: well fuck it. two of us then \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: Three\\nFriend: Want smth from store?\\nFriend: Fire late\nSo snack good\\nPersona: Laura?\\nPersona: hmm what you take for yourself, take for me too\\nPersona: have you met Elias?\\nFriend: Who's that\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\\nFriend: we were just having drinks and playing board games until 6 in the morning\\nFriend: how was yours?\\nPersona: the fireworks weren't that good here haha, I was also home\\nPersona: I had literallly the most chill too\\nPersona: I felt a bit sick so stayed home, talked with friends on discord\\nPersona: So I am alive and healthy today, apart from having an inverse daynight cycle for the past wekk\\nFriend: oh god, I'm so sick of those. it felt like going through a war zone when I was biking to the dorm from home\\nFriend: aw shame I didn't know. you could've joined us\\nFriend: glad it's nothing serious. you're coming back to school already or you're having a longer Christmas break?\\nPersona: isn't the bass you feel in your chest after an explosion kind of thrilling to you?\\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\\nPersona: give me a sec\\nPersona: some ideas\\nPersona: topics rather\\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha"

The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login. If I could build an automated setup that retrieves all of the loan data frequently, looks for differences to see what changed, I could get a good sense of the market and have really assymetric information. Also some people sell loans that are late. If I could get a notif that a loan got returned and is still on sale for a late-like discount, if i could buy it quickly I could win a lot.\\nPersona: no returned but no longer late I mena\\nPersona: I never thought it has a name\\nPersona: just knowing the name its easier to get the minority diasgreeing party to subdue after decision is made\\nPersona: cause giving it a label will make ppl thinks its legit to commit after diagreeing so they can save face and their ego\\nPersona: I will use this\\nPersona: I just used it now on myself\\nFriend: that's a good strat\\nFriend: could make a scraper that regularly refreshes the page or something\\nFriend: worst case is if they have some limits or notice abnormal activity from your IP and decide to block you\\nFriend: can help with the IT part :D that sounds like a fun project\\nFriend: you in dk? what you up to?\\nFriend: I just had my last exam friday so im a free boy for a little while\\nFriend: will just go to work sometimes and do some ad hoc life tasks and such\\nPersona: congrats on finishing your bachelors \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: how did it go?\\nPersona: Yeah I am in DK.

Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: But\\nFriend: No\\nPersona: if they get the one time pass, they wont get an actual pass generator\\nPersona: the pass generator key is like a private key thats never sent\\nFriend: Maybe they will\nIf they get your session cookie or something\\nFriend: And if they can refresh it\\nPersona: (of course if its http, then session cookie is risk)\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: yeah thats true\\nFriend: Unless site kicks you out even after active time\\nPersona: yeah I guess you can esily get hacked on http, that was too large of an assumption haha\\nFriend: XD\nThey wont steal your phone and the 2nd factor\\nPersona: but you get the point. Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Most probably not\\nPersona: alright buddy, see ya tommorow, have a good rave\\nPersona: if you in need fir a chauffeur for the night let me know\\nFriend: Alrighty, see ya tomorrow!\\nPersona: Tommorow 14:30 movie is Dumb Money, price 60dkk at Palace, me and Petyo (and prob his gf) are going\\nPersona: Do you want to join?\\nPersona: with Kaja\\nPersona: So I can be a third wheel for two couples \ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Boulders are at 4pm\\nFriend: So I can't xd\\nPersona: we can go to boulders at 17\\nPersona: but if you are busy or dont want, no worriea\\nPersona: I founs this thesis by a CBS masters student about P2P loans\\nPersona: I didnt read all of it, but the conclusions was that the one who already returned well for a few months are less likely to default, as they usually default in the beginning\\nPersona: so I looked up on one of my platforms secondary market, where people can liquidate/resell their investments\\nPersona: and I know there are some ppl who always try to do it for some premium, say 2-7%, so they get instant profit a bit without waiting\\nPersona: I then browsed for loans that already returned more than 6 months on time and has less than 2-3 years left. If a loan has a rate like 25%+, even if the person is asking for 5% premium, I could buy it and then it would become a 20% loan for me, but with lower risk, as the person was already paying on time for a while\\nPersona: I think I got a history of 400+ loans, I been looking forward to doing some analysis to actually find strategies to optimize this\\nPersona: baught 2 like those right noe\\nPersona: now*\\nPersona: will check sometimes, and then see\\nFriend: uuu and the research was on danish market or european? there can be some cultural differencies which can impact the risk\\nFriend: or even economic state, like now we are close to recession so that can also make an impact\\nPersona: I dont remember\\nPersona: when I see it again I can tell you\\nPersona: I need to look into how loans respond to economic downturns\\nPersona: during corona it was chill\\nPersona: are you conspirint about smth big it a normal cycle recession?\\nPersona: europe just has a recession\\nPersona: Why do you think a recession is coming?\\nPersona: maybe because of inflation\\nFriend: because we increasing our intrest rates and that almost always outcomes in recession\\nFriend: as investment decreases\\nFriend: gdp decreases too\\nFriend: so that's also a risk for you as the loans you give also get a 5% central bank intrest rate\\nFriend: and if people/companies are arleady in debt then this 5% can make a huge differences in their business stability and development\\nFriend: I don't travel with my weed\\nFriend: Xddd\\nPersona: thats for krem\\nPersona: or lubricant, safety cum, etc\\nFriend: Mehhh\\nFriend: Don't travel with that either\\nPersona: L'auberge espagnole\\nFriend: Why you think so\\nPersona: It captures multicultural experience very well\\nFriend: Gonna check it out\\nFriend: Can i watch it on Netflix or Disney?\\nPersona: Not sure\\nFriend: Seeds sucks\\nPersona: Yeah this one sucks, but there is another one on 1337x thats like 1gb or smth"

Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade.

Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: What is the quickest and cleanest way using only HTML (no css stylesheet) to center a paragraph on a horizontal axis with a picture.\\nPersona: I am sending ecom sites descriptions of products and I am including html tags in them to do some styling\\nFriend: maybe possible with inline elements\n\notherwise tables\n\nbut css is best if you can use at least inline css\\nFriend: if you send me the thing I can test if inline elements can work for it\\nPersona: I can use style tag, but not in separte file\\nFriend: ye thats ok\\nPersona: The site is this\\nPersona: this better\\nPersona: (I resend)\\nFriend: dont send code in fb x__x hard to copy\nfile\npastebin\ngoogle docs\nanything else pls\n\nare you able to change this html you sent me to whatever you want?\\nPersona: The description goes under \"APRA\u0160YMAS\" if it makes a difference\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: pastebin does not work for me I hate it\\nPersona: wait\\nFriend: whatever you prefer \njust not messenger\n\nbut thats ok.

Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff"

Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yeah its go3\\nPersona: There is one prob with it, but maybe its due to my phone\\nPersona: have to test with someone else phone\\nFriend: whats wrong\\nPersona: The volume scale is non linear\\nPersona: and it jumps.sharply at the worst point\\nFriend: at start?\n I have that at low volume with my raider\\nPersona: I disabled adaptive valume or whatever it is called.

How many posts monthly do you assume are there?\\nPersona: do you like coding?\\nFriend: yeah it is idk how many but i would assume for 1 website called eurodressage that is pretty famouns maybe 50\\nFriend: but idk i would have to ask the administre\\nFriend: no but i could learn to like it\\nPersona: When you say tinder like app, you mean that it has matching / swiping mechanic? or we are talking about a dba like app?\\nPersona: but anyways, its not very important\\nPersona: 50 posts a month, maybe 100 - 200 if you can beat all competition is something that doesn't sound like an obvious business case immediately, it may be though\\nFriend: i feel like a swiping mechanic would be pretty good. So people get a little preview of the horses. Problem is that people post a picture of their horses face on the \u201cfront\u201d of the post but that doesent tell u anything. So swiping and then a \u201creel\u201d type preview would be so good\\nPersona: Honestly, are you more insterested in making this app happen (and additionally making money from it), or you are more interested in the learning process of coding an app?\\nFriend: and then fx when we scout horses in the netherlands it would be amazing to have the tinder function where u could set a preference in terms of do age and level and then swipe for horses close to your location\\nFriend: can i be interested in both?\\nPersona: It sounds fun, the logic behind it is probably not hard. You are looking at a front-end UI design, database and a pretty simple backend. The algorithm for the matching is probably not going to be very complex too.\\nPersona: It may be a bit advanced on animations and making that 'its a match' tinder like feeling\\nFriend: mostly the first part bc i think it would take me some time to learn to code for real but i would really like to learn it tho. \nNot necessarily be super super good but i would love to be able to actually use it in practice\\nPersona: You can, but if really what you want is to learn coding and app development, then go ahead, do it, learn to code. I can recommend a good course how to develop iOS and android apps at the same time with Flutter.\\nPersona: If actually what you want is to make this app happen, then start by validating the market and need thoroughly, before you start putting your time and money into it. The next step in that case I would recommend it to apply for CSE, where you can have business development sessions with nice experts, which give you good guidance what to do next, how to validate the business case, and proceed with making it happen. If the business case proves to be big enough, you could hire a developer that would make you such an app, given that you are pretty busy already, and someone also needs to do the commercial aspects of the business.\\nPersona: When I say 'do it, learn to code' I mean do the app while learning to code.\\nPersona: The course by the way, is around 40 hours, not expensive. but its possible to get for free\\nPersona: I took it and its a really good one. The teacher makes a few apps while teaching, which include a marketplace app, a chatting and some other smaller apps.\\nPersona: You seem to be talking about making apps again and again, so it seems like you have this interests and if you decide to learn app dev and can give it some time in your schedule, I think you can do it.\\nPersona: just call me when you on laptop, I am making it already \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: oh i didn\u2019t see your text just had dinner i\u2019ll call u in 5 if you\u2019re still working on it\\nFriend: victoriabd@live.dk\\nPersona: your wifi might be gone\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: vic, my festival casual, perhaps you a have air pump for inflatable mattress to lend for two days?\\nFriend: just had a look around the farm and actually no i don\u2019t\\nFriend: i found 1 but it\u2019s humongous i don\u2019t think it can even be in my trunk\\nPersona: humomgus xddd\\nPersona: made me grin\\nPersona: But thanks for checking\\nPersona: this parking\\nPersona: parked there many times\\nPersona: you have the permit right?\\nFriend: okay great thanks!\\nFriend: yes\\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Ohhhhh\\nPersona: Yeah I know him\\nFriend: he want fuck us in the us with his double dildo\\nFriend: do you know his dildo?\\nPersona: Yea, he has some good ones\\nFriend: shish now im hyped\\nFriend: when can we meet up?\\nPersona: On feb 14, 22:00\\nFriend: that's a perfect day for this special occasion\\nFriend: should I book tickets to Paris?\\nPersona: Lets go Madagaskar\\nPersona: warmer\\nFriend: good point\\nPersona: wtf they made payday3. Didn't even notice\\nFriend: Uuu\\nFriend: Probably it's bad\\nFriend: That why nobody speaks about it\\nPersona: yeah its bad \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I read the comments\\nPersona: no just 1 beer\\nPersona: but\\nPersona: It felt like a lot\\nFriend: Thats wierd, maybe your liver is dying\\nPersona: nah bro\\nPersona: I am good\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Airidas!!!?\\nFriend: Would you like to play cs go 2?\\nPersona: yo\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: is that you\\nPersona: furmaniak\\nFriend: Now you write to me?

It something MacOS has by default and that was a game changer for me with only two monitors, so at home, on Windows, with only 1 monitor, I had to have it\\nPersona: It allows switching virtual dekstops with one hand and allows easility moving windows between virtual dekstop with one key combo and one hand\\nPersona: and does not require additional software\\nPersona: I included it in the code I sent\\nFriend: Ah the win+tab?\\nPersona: yeah, but win tab vanilla is inefficient af\\nPersona: it requires atleast two clicks and a mouse movement or more clicks to, or multiple hand to get job done vanilla way\\nPersona: Also unrelated but\\nPersona: Logseq is radioactive\\nPersona: its OP af, yet a bit unstable and weird inside. With proper meta I can handle it very well and utilize its immense utility\\nPersona: Created some OP ahk shortcuts that make some features much faster to access which pushes the cost of using them lower to the extent that it climbs over the OP threshold\\nPersona: aand then I discovered the whiteboard feature\\nPersona: I now can finally start drawing during work meetings without pen and paper, since my digital personality does.not like pen and paper\\nPersona: its worth learning lithuanian languagr just to watch this video\\nPersona: Congratulations with your day \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: thank you\\nPersona: Kill it with the exams \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\\nPersona: and we have fun on the weeknd\\nPersona: hows exams mate?\\nFriend: not great but it's over\\nFriend: only bachelors project left\\nPersona: sounds bif\\nPersona: Hey man, wanna do smth in the evening?\\nPersona: Maybr a movie at my dorm\\nPersona: ayo yo\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f missed your call.\\nFriend: Hey! \nI wake up like 14 and feel dead\\nFriend: I real wake up around now\\nFriend: need to find a way to accommodate my body to normal life\\nPersona: :o\\nPersona: exam?\\nFriend: but if you down movie this week\\nPersona: gaming?\\nFriend: both\\nFriend: dangerous combo\\nPersona: Me and patryk are maybe going to cook some steaks at my placr\\nPersona: you want to join?\\nPersona: Can probably pick you up\\nFriend: how late are you staying\n\nI can be ready and come in 3 hrs maybe?\\nPersona: hm not sure\\nPersona: I will let you know\\nPersona: Yo yo yo\\nPersona: lets go\\nPersona: steaks\\nPersona: no time to wait 3 hours\\nPersona: steaks will be eaten by then\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f missed your call.\\nFriend: x__x"

And vannilla formulas are good cause they fast.\\nFriend: Wth :DDD this looks fun\n\nGood way to learn imo\nEven tho they said its not tutorial\\nFriend: So now your sheet will be easier to work with?\nLike auto row expansions\\nPersona: yuuup\\nPersona: I just did a killer formula yesterday. One formula replaced 1750 \u00d7 8 formulas\\nPersona: and it auto grows to more columns if I add more jar definitions\\nPersona: With two MAP() functions I was able to do a nested loop and with LET() I saved some complexity by not evaluating same thing twice\\nPersona: So now I just need to fill in the inputs and it like auto expands the autocalc ones\\nPersona: also since I can handle auto expansion with Sheets, there are less bug when AppSheet tries to auto expand stuff (AppSheet sucks at that in some rare instances)\\nFriend: Looking forward to see the magic :D\n\nMeanwhile I'll go learn how these formulas work\\nPersona: Do you have any top level advice on unfucking page load speed?\\nFriend: For cms wordpress sites, add some optimization plugins and pray you can near 2 seconds or 3\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: I have that already, static caching on the cms side + CDN caching\\nFriend: Lazy load\nCaching\n\nWhatnot\\nFriend: Inspect page load \n\nWith something like lighthouse\\nFriend: Will give you a lot of insight\\nPersona: Yeah I been into this whole day\\nFriend: Which scripts or what is fucky\\nPersona: I was hoping there was some silver bullet but I guess not xd\\nFriend: Depends on what you have\n\nMake static html page and there won't be anything faster than that\\nFriend: But with a cms you can't expect miracles\\nFriend: Cause they load some fucky plugins\\nPersona: i dont think cms is prob\\nFriend: And you ask you CMO if you can remove a fhcky plugin and he says no\\nPersona: Cause even when response is cached on a CDN all around the world\\nPersona: load time is shit on mobile.

Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: And time of day a d station\\nPersona: would you be able to use that 4 thesis?\\nFriend: I can ask if im allowed \nProbably not too secret\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: why is it not so simple to delete a cookie with js?\\nFriend: Set age to negative?\\nFriend: Idk\nIs it hard\\nPersona: but only of one key value pair\\nPersona: the cookie is a string\\nPersona: and contains 100 individual cookie key val pairs\\nPersona: I only need to delete one\\nFriend: The cookie is what\\nFriend: Bruh don't use cookie for storage\\nFriend: Just an identifier or something\\nFriend: Can you not remove one key from all\\nPersona: I need to delete this one cookie \"legalmonster-...-concent\" if its equal to {} cause there was a bug and if some browsers have this cookie as {} it causes problem\\nPersona: how do I remove a specific one cookie key value pair?

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\\nFriend: I'm gonna focus on his literature.

You really have to make sure that your skill is noticed\\nPersona: This guide really reminds me of Lithuanian older generation\\nPersona: Also after reading this guide I realized I also had a wrong understanding of 'arrogant'\\nPersona: With your help I will redefine my whole vocab\\nPersona: I think this evening I had the most social experience in our anti-social kitchen\\nPersona: 4 of us were holding an inclusive conversation for a considerable time\\nPersona: Good luck today!\\nPersona: How did it go?\\nPersona: Hope it went alright, and if not - stay strong, its tough there out in the market \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\\nFriend: jesus christ, it freaks me out so much when someone not Polish uses impeccable Polish out of the blue \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: sorry, I was just stressed. it went okay-ish, I guess? at least it ended up on 'maybe sth could come out of this'. they are setting up a new lab, a few studies are running now, they have a clinical trial in prep. due to that they will need someone to help around with everything as a part timer. the main issue is my non-Danishness bc their patients don't really speak English, so they need to think if they can get around this\\nFriend: it's all very uncertain, and it looks like it'll take a long time until I'll know anything for sure, e. g. they will get an answer regarding the grant for the clinical only mid-May\\nFriend: for now I have a 2nd meeting with them on Feb 9th\\nPersona: wait, please dont say you think I made this \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: part time? Are you actually looking for part-time?\\nPersona: They invited you for second meeting deapite lack or danishness, thats good - they saw something else extraordinary in you.\\nPersona: although I would apply to more places in the meantime\\nFriend: haha no, of course not. I'm just violated by unexpected Polish\\nFriend: oh yeah. initially I even offered to work unpaid as an intern/volunteer, whatever you want to call it. it's them who insist to pay me\\nPersona: we have those in Lithuania too, sent by boomers on facebook\\nPersona: I have some advanved ones to unveal\\nPersona: \ud83e\udee3\\nPersona: is the competition so fierce ther\u0119?\\nFriend: I think it's not so much about competition. it's just everything is grant dependent and studies are expensive, so the funds stretch out only so far\\nFriend: and it's not exactly like academia works. I can count on my fingers the places that do work aligned with what I'm specialized in and all these people know each other so you need to tread carefully\\nFriend: hahah this at least has meme energy. the 1st one was Def something my mum would do if she had any it skills\\nPersona: okay, you seem to have in insider look into academia business. Then thread carefully as you say\\nPersona: Are you going to take more education, why arent you looking for full time?\\nPersona: is it because of this reason?\\nFriend: no, I mean, you know it's not that I specifically want to work part-time\\nFriend: but hiring someone full-time in cph costs what? probs easily half a mill a year\\nFriend: so it's not always an option\\nFriend: and I'd rather do sth I want to do, that do sth I'm not super interested in with better working conditions\\nFriend: once you are enrolled into a phd it's easier bc you are funded by your own grant so you're not a financial burden\\nFriend: but few get straight into a phd. for most, you need to slave around for quite a bit before you get to that point\\nFriend: the benefit of that place I'm talking to is that they are really well connected to everyone else in the city and collab a lot\\nPersona: If you are comparing part-time hourly wage vs full-time wage, then yes, part-timer who has finished her masters is a deal, almost a robbery. If the hourly wages are somewhat equal, then, at least in the industry, I think companies prefer full-time employees, cause they learn faster, are there all the time, less relative management costs\\nFriend: so if they don't want me long-term maybe I could weasel my way in somewhere else\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby? Got to know your roomie better?\\nFriend: actually did a little ye\nwas a nice start to our cohabiting life :D\\nFriend: i knew some stuff from before \ncause she seems very active at home\n\nI was going out\n\nand she just takes the initiative to arrange things and make it nice\\nPersona: yeah good stuff, seems you were both into bringing more life and action into your household\\nFriend: like good wife material vibes\\nPersona: xdddddd\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: she nice too\\nFriend: yeah? you see it too?\\nPersona: XDDD\\nPersona: nah not too much\\nPersona: Well in a way yes\\nFriend: xD ok must be just my imagination\\nPersona: But, she pretty youthful\\nPersona: oh wait wife meterial? yeah\\nPersona: Definetely\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: and now its really telling me that I need to change the password of production database\\nPersona: I am getting worried xddd\\nPersona: like its very convincing\\nFriend: Two options\\nFriend: Change it quietly everywhere\\nFriend: Or ring the alarms to cto and be brutally honest about stupid mistake\\nFriend: So he fixes and forgives\\nPersona: Umm, idk what effect changing will do so will not risk that\\nFriend: Will feel bad but it will work out imo\\nFriend: Ask gpt what to do xd\\nPersona: The database seems to not allow external conenctions, like under a VPN, where only internal processes can connect\\nPersona: So as long as this is disabled, I am safe\\nPersona: I think\\nPersona: thus\\nPersona: I will not tell and show my stupidity\\nFriend: Oh\\nFriend: Yeah sounds safe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Is there a way to find if the database exists externally \n\nOr trying to connect would feel like more than just the pw is wrong?\\nPersona: Yeah, I will try connecting\\nPersona: I got a raise today \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: from 145hr to 175hr now and pottentially 187.5hr in 6 months\\nPersona: hows been your life now\\nPersona: in freedom\\nFriend: man it's very good jump\nand potential salary promise sounds good too\\nFriend: but I think (depending on how much you grow) it could be low\\nFriend: freedom good but I didn't use it to be free\\nFriend: was a bit of an adult\ndid other stuff with time\\nFriend: been looking into the housing market in denmark\n\nlearning different rules and looking at apartments/houses\\nFriend: shits fun af to research\\nFriend: apparently you don't owe taxes when you buy a house and then sell it for profit\\nFriend: crazy stuff.. \nif it really is that simple, I'll become house flipper one day\\nFriend: I just used an hour of my time to set up a friend with an email\n\nhe wants custom domain on the emails\nwe bought it\n\nmade microsoft 365 \n\nmade emails with the custom domain for his employees\n\nconnected the calendars so he sees whatsup\\nFriend: feels so good using my skills for good\\nFriend: if you get free we can do something\\nFriend: i still have some time til im student again on the 29th :D\\nPersona: I think I am a pretty good deal to them even with the salary increase. But I think it might be too hard to climb to the maximum\\nPersona: maximum is the SU limit\\nPersona: hard because its coming from 145hr\\nFriend: You can go over \nBut then they start lowering SU a bit too :/\\nFriend: SU limit isn't too bad\nThey raised it to like 17k a month\\nFriend: So once you \"reach\" max you have to start working less hours  to increase the pr hour without going over\\nPersona: yeah ik\\nPersona: Yeah, but that would mean job change. Cause who would want to have a good talent work less\\nPersona: did you contact Marcus?\\nPersona: yaah, I heard about this\\nPersona: ahaha please don't you got better talent\\nPersona: :o nice\\nPersona: if you want to help me with some crazy complex tasks at work regarding web dev, you are very welcome xd\\nPersona: not crazy complex\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like."

Be careful not to condemn yourself with two years of studying something that you dont have natural curiocity in. Healthcare requires a lot of patience, due to trials, intelectual property. May also require more than normal paperwork, compliance, regulation. \n\nIts a noble field tho.\\nPersona: I have been to HealthHub copenhagen a few times, where they center innovation in health, and thats my impression\\nPersona: There is a course broadly for innovation at CBS\\nPersona: to buy another vape or not to buy\\nFriend: xdddd\\nFriend: don't do it!\\nFriend: why you chose flutter instead of one of js frameworks?\\nPersona: What kind of js frameworks are you talking about?\\nPersona: Because many of them are for web only. Flutter is cross-platform.\\nPersona: But if you are talking why not React Native, which is the only js SDK that I would else consider, I dont have a clear answer\\nPersona: It was mostly intuition, or just the idea of going with one of them. You can do great things with any\\nPersona: And I don't regret it after learning. I have met many flutter devs in europe and no react native weirdly\\nFriend: I'm thinking about react and node.js\\nFriend: Oh really?\\nPersona: Are you thinking about web apps or cross-platform/mobile apps?\\nFriend: Cross platform\\nPersona: do you mean React Native?\\nPersona: Then go for react native.\\nPersona: You could also consider PWAs too, but they are riskier, maybe not that polished technology yet and a new standard\\nPersona: You can make PWAs with just React probably\\nPersona: why are you asking?\\nPersona: Do you want to become a software dev?\\nPersona: Start with web based platform them, if you are making things for tutors. Unless you focus is mobile\\nPersona: If I had to choose in this moment a JS framework to learn for web, I would go with Svelte\\nPersona: PWAs work differently a bit. They are broswer based 'native' apps\\nPersona: so they are fully rendered, executed by the browser but can have native app functionality\\nPersona: like being put on homescreen\\nPersona: or having offline access\\nPersona: I dont know enough to really breakdown the cons and pros, maybe google can help you\\nPersona: Building a mobile and web app at the same time will really slow you down\\nPersona: so if mobile is an extra\\nPersona: then for your first project, I would make it straight in web\\nPersona: Because React Native or Flutter will mostly likely be shit for web compared to frameworks specialized for web, like React or Svelte\\nFriend: True that\\nFriend: Will check the svelte\\nFriend: Yeah that's what I read\\nPersona: Petyo probably knows more about js frameworks than me\\nPersona: so you could ask him\\nPersona: but just do it!\\nPersona: its better to do it with something not fully fitting than not do it at all\\nPersona: ugh I am craving vape\\nPersona: I need to stop addiction\\nFriend: you need to find another addiction to cure the old one\\nFriend: have you thought about cocaine?\\nPersona: hmm idk. does it also have so nice tastes?\\nFriend: Unfortunately not, but it makes everything else nice\\nPersona: Ok, I will try\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: seems like react is making a comeback\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: And anything that has a time i try to immediately put in the calendar so i can keep track of life\\nPersona: I been experimenting with notion for a while and idk, it does not stick to me\\nPersona: Whole day I was researching note taking apps\\nPersona: I feel it takes very long to make notes in Notion and having everything on many pages, things get lost and navigation takes time.\\nPersona: Also I like the toggleable bullet list approach that MindManager for example uses\\nPersona: Its hard for me to write in paragraph style\\nPersona: I am experimenting with Obsidian and Logseq\\nPersona: Obsidian is super cool, but its paragraph style\\nPersona: Loqseq is bullet point style\\nPersona: I watched note-taking, seconds brain apps for whole video and there was no mention of Mindmanager\\nPersona: I might be too uses to it now, its really hard to switch. I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\\nPersona: yo wtf\\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\\nPersona: click the three dots\\nPersona: and there is install app button\\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\\nPersona: thats pretty cool\\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\\nPersona: and mortgages\\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\\nPersona: this is from a book\\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\\nPersona: And things get interesting then\\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\\nPersona: but hmm\\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\\nFriend: to help you get there?\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\\nPersona: Need to fix that\\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\\nPersona: oh ok\\nPersona: goodluck\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\\nPersona: P2P loans platform that I use has a secondary market where you can resell you investments. The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login. If I could build an automated setup that retrieves all of the loan data frequently, looks for differences to see what changed, I could get a good sense of the market and have really assymetric information. Also some people sell loans that are late. If I could get a notif that a loan got returned and is still on sale for a late-like discount, if i could buy it quickly I could win a lot.\\nPersona: no returned but no longer late I mena\\nPersona: I never thought it has a name\\nPersona: just knowing the name its easier to get the minority diasgreeing party to subdue after decision is made\\nPersona: cause giving it a label will make ppl thinks its legit to commit after diagreeing so they can save face and their ego\\nPersona: I will use this\\nPersona: I just used it now on myself\\nFriend: that's a good strat\\nFriend: could make a scraper that regularly refreshes the page or something\\nFriend: worst case is if they have some limits or notice abnormal activity from your IP and decide to block you\\nFriend: can help with the IT part :D that sounds like a fun project\\nFriend: you in dk? what you up to?\\nFriend: I just had my last exam friday so im a free boy for a little while\\nFriend: will just go to work sometimes and do some ad hoc life tasks and such\\nPersona: congrats on finishing your bachelors \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: how did it go?\\nPersona: Yeah I am in DK.

Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\\nPersona: give me a sec\\nPersona: some ideas\\nPersona: topics rather\\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world.

Or even have negative effect on capital.\\nPersona: We no longer need reproduction for fitness growth, thus we may be able to have fitness growth without death as we can get rid of overpopulation by not reproducing (or reproducing at a rate = increase in carbon energy generation capacity)\\nPersona: But young people may however have higher contributions to capital though, due to neuroplasticity. So death may still be optimal.\\nPersona: lol I should stop\\nPersona: I wrote a whole essay here\\nFriend: Fitness setting (current gene) iskinda like knowledge but different\n\nCapital too\\nPersona: I dont get what you mean\\nPersona: Idk bro, I keep changing my opinions\\nPersona: maybe fitness is no longer survival rn\\nPersona: There might be no generally aplicable abstract truth.We are just pieces of predetermined matter in motion\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude16\\nFriend: i think fitness still survival\\nFriend: but we are able to use something more than evolutionary reaction and randomness to survival\\nPersona: what is evolutionary r\u0119action?\\nFriend: cause\\nFriend: the tool for survival of things\\nFriend: is \"make as many of us as possible\"\\nFriend: and let randomness decide whats good\\nPersona: Yeah thats one iteration\\nPersona: Then the dominant one gets to replicate most\\nFriend: but with societal structures and knowledge it changes a bit\\nFriend: and its more like which society is better kind of\\nFriend: but I feel like we can't afford at this stage to let things run it's course and \"test\"\n\nyou either make it or die\n\nlike with things coming into the far future like inevitable sun death \n\nor maybe meteor hitting earth\\nPersona: Genetica I think became almost irrelevant. Its took billions of years. We just took 4000 years to double peoplea life expectancy\\nPersona: Using capital\\nPersona: I lost you there\\nPersona: Testing with death as an answer is no longer relevant\\nPersona: mutations are slow and take thousands of yearz\\nFriend: as in, now it's less evolution on the human level\n\nit's more on the structure that humans are\\nFriend: like a humans evolution is less about the evolution of it's cells\n\nit's more about the evolution of the environment and system that sets up those cells\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: so humans maybe are more irrelevant in the big picture and a big organism made of humans is forming\\nPersona: Agree\\nPersona: But what is the meaning of one concious indicidual then?\\nFriend: but depending on the perspective you could argue there aren't many organisms of humans\n\nlike currently there are. Countries and what not\nand you have some thriving better\n\nbut interstellar wise its just 1 colony\\nFriend: and if its just 1 organism\n\nand it dies\n\ngame over\\nPersona: yeah maybe its smth bigger\\nPersona: But our progress is a bit isolates though\\nPersona: rn its only on earth pretty much ( well technically our solar system maybe )\\nPersona: we were optimized there in isolation\\nPersona: we are not yet competing with anyone else\\nFriend: yeah\nits more relevant to \"the creation of the first organism\"\\nFriend: how tf did the first one survive\\nFriend: it probably didnt\\nPersona: it didnt until a random arrangement allowed it to replicate\\nPersona: probably\\nFriend: holy fuck xD the first ever organism and you are sitting there like \"wtf. Where is my splitting ability\"\\nFriend: soo uh yeah.. hoomans are probably doomed but maybe not\\nPersona: Even if that organism could survive, if it coulnd replicate, it would.not continue\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: what do i compare that to\\nPersona: Can you send me the whole question?\\nPersona: it says that the price of the call option is 4.5. 39 > 4.5, thus underpriced\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i forgot to mobilepay you for the cases\\nPersona: Received it, thanks \u2764\\nFriend: Can I park at the school without a special permit just for a few hours?\\nPersona: Yeah, then go to the campus desk and ask a permit for today\\nPersona: or make on online, its granted instantly\\nPersona: Its on sharepoint\\nPersona: ok lol this is top notch entertainment\\nFriend: hahah i know\\nFriend: good for you\\nFriend: you got tik tok\\nFriend: welcome to no attention span\\nPersona: I am scared for my wellbeing now\\nFriend: how's it going\\nPersona: pretty not bad\\nPersona: maybe 60% finished the 1st part, but got some ideas for the remaining parts\\nFriend: thats pretty not bad yeah\\nPersona: Actually chatgpt is pretty stupid on understanding the perspectives, but now I am really exploiting it with the promt \"Make this text smooth\" and then I give it my ungramatical, however, however, and and filled hard to understand text that I wrote very quickly and it melts it into an academic masterpiece\\nPersona: And did you finish yours?\\nPersona: Did you find the ideas for part 3?\\nFriend: oh cool!\\nFriend: thats really nice\\nFriend: yeah i am missing like 3 paragraphs of part 3 but i dont think that will get me to more than 12-13 pages\\nFriend: so idk\\nPersona: I think the part 1 is easily inflatable\\nPersona: cause its so general the way I get it\\nFriend: true but do you think it matters a lot\\nPersona: just pump some air into that maybe, so atleast they don't punish you for not using up the pages.\\nFriend: i am just over this... to me org theory is bs\\nPersona: I think yeah, its the least interesting part\\nFriend: ill try\\nFriend: but tbh my brain is done soon\\nPersona: ITs 3 am\\nPersona: I am commited to whole night actually\\nPersona: maybe if I can make it till 8am, I;ll show up to the lecture\\nFriend: yeha i also surpassed the tired level by now but my ideas are not coming through very well now\\nFriend: omfg no\\nFriend: would you then not sleep at all\\nPersona: I am literally a kamikaze. I went to the lecture today, then also to an event at CSE, and have the rest of the week packed with stuff. My dark circles under the eyes can't get worse at this point\\nFriend: your brain will crash airi wtf\\nPersona: Yup, eventually you surprass that. I don't know how to make ideas come better though\\nFriend: how are u awake?\\nPersona: yeah but its mostly because of the damned DO. If not DO I would be much healthier\\nFriend: and fucntioning\\nFriend: hahaha\\nFriend: A few weeks ago i was taking care of my horse bc he was sick so for 3 days straight both night and day I had to check on him and do some medical stuff every 2 hours without breaks\\nPersona: I may have addiciton to energy drinks\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\\nPersona: I can be your test rat\\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\\nFriend: and we measure the difference\\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\\nFriend: who said that's desired?\\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\\nFriend: well, was worth a try \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\\nPersona: that is a cool way. Cant you also be your own study subject? I will randomize the piwko for you\\nPersona: the its n=2\\nPersona: But why not? I want both fancy, what do you mean?\\nPersona: Our language is oldest european, so they stole from us \ud83e\udd78\\nPersona: that is true\\nPersona: somehow\\nPersona: I remember back in highschool I had the desperate friends, with whom I drank sometimes and they were really seeking for tips how to get drunk cheapest. Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society\\nPersona: You know these magical tilted, or inversed rooms, where things are glue to the ground and the the room is tilted, so it looks like normal one, but when you walk on semingly flat ground, you are going on a strong incline? Maybe that could be a great start\\nFriend: that's unethical. as you can see, I care about ethics very much\\nFriend: oh, are you? that means that we evolve in the direction of fewer fancy letters over time. now that's sad. keep your fancy letters the\\nFriend: then*\\nFriend: oh yeah I was that person. tough we used to drink the legendary sulfur-loaded wine Amarena in old bunkers instead of going to school. I bet every dumb thing I've done in my life can be traced back to brain damage induced by that luxury beverage\\nFriend: it's like 7-8kr per bottle\\nFriend: and we also call the moonshine samogon (or more commonly bomber), though it was more of an 80s thing\\nFriend: keep in mind that during my experiments I need to maintain low social battery, so everyone pisses me off. no one's safe\\nFriend: are you sponsored by some straw company? I'm getting suspicious\\nFriend: excellent. everything is going as planned\\nFriend: yeah, it crossed my mind as well, but then your feet are still on the ground so it's not perfect. we need a chair\\nFriend: I also considered shooting people into space or sending them on a weightless flight, but I'm not sure how I feel about that yet\\nFriend: bimber* not bomber \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: some of them are of very very trivial utility I think, while being a super common typo and mistake source\\nPersona: like there should be no \u0105, just a.\\nPersona: Or no \u0173, just u and \u016b is enough"

If you try, let me know\\nFriend: And i wrote her cause laptop got spill\nI just needed code they sent her\\nPersona: :DDD\\nPersona: bro\\nPersona: you really need to fix your pw mangement\\nFriend: Yep\\nPersona: for smth like you that very embarrasing tbh\\nPersona: I am surprised\\nFriend: Know what she said?\\nPersona: what\\nFriend: That she wont tell me cause she was scared for security\\nFriend: Sorry i really wanna help, if there is anything i can do let me know\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: wow looks beautiful\\nPersona: how did the taste turn out?\\nPersona: Just handed in last exam\\nFriend: Not gonna be humble and say that I liked it better than the ones from restaurants hah\\nFriend: Perfectly spicy with a big dose of umami. + marinated shiitake can save any soup, I love making them\\nFriend: But I had friends over so nothing\u2019s left, gonna make more today to have for later\\nFriend: Yesss\\nFriend: Congrats!\\nFriend: So you\u2019re free now?

I still force myself to get up in the morning and do whatever I planned but I can sometimes stay up till 3-4am\\nFriend: The only time I got full night of sleep was on Thursday when I got back to Poland. Was so tired that I slept like a baby xd\\nFriend: But I\u2019m trying to use this time by studying or making some christmas stuff\\nFriend: Today I made a julstj\u00e4rna. Bringing Denmark home hah\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: dont worry\\nPersona: once u get so tired\\nPersona: you will fall asleep doing anything\\nPersona: is that danish song?\\nPersona: or the ornament is danish?\\nPersona: bike is still at CBD\\nPersona: CBS*\\nPersona: and I am not picking it up\\nFriend: It\u2019s alt-j, irrelevant to the whole thing haha\\nFriend: Poor guy\\nFriend: Hey, are you still planning to be gaming tomorrow?\\nPersona: Yesss\\nPersona: thats the opportunity\\nFriend: May I join you? \ud83e\udd20\\nFriend: Later in the evening\\nPersona: Hmm, not sure, it depends on how much can you play and what can you play\\nPersona: because for some games like Rimworld, if you can only play one evening then its not worth it\\nPersona: what is your PC specs?\\nFriend: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060\n11th gen i5-11400\n16GB ram\\nFriend: I decided to give myself a break for Christmas so i can play\\nPersona: no waaay\\nFriend: Way\\nFriend: Whats up\\nPersona: you can play almost anything\\nPersona: last time when we played you had smth much slower\\nFriend: Didn\u2019t change anything \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: ah maybe on one of the laptios\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Hey, u pre partying for the party somewhere?\\nPersona: Are you in town?\\nFriend: Nah, we just left the kea party and heading home\\nPersona: Me and petyo metting in the center at this party shop, getting dressed up\\nPersona: wanna join?\\nPersona: also chug a few beers\\nFriend: I don't think I'm even gonna make it to the party, haven't been drinking either.

I'm most probably going for exchange to Barcelona and was thinking about looking for some remote job from Copenhagen, any kind, jsut to secure SU. Do you maybe know any company/anybody offering such positions?\\nPersona: I don't know any position being sough in particular. I know that on Linked In they mark some positions as available for remote work, so apply into those\\nPersona: My friend also works at CBS as student assitant and the job is very easy and also she can travel alot, so maybe look at KEA student assistant or even try at CBS student assistant.\\nFriend: Aight aight, I'll try to have a look at those\\nFriend: Cheers bro\\nPersona: good luck!\\nFriend: Thanks!\\nFriend: Yoo bud, you in Copenhagen or still on holidays?:Dd\\nPersona: Hey, still abroad \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Alrighty alrighty, enjoy then! \nI'm leaving for exchange on 2nd of August, so I guess we'll catch up sometime!\\nPersona: How long is the exchange?

Grind?\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: Did flutter all day basically\\nPersona: flutter is free time\\nPersona: Its super relaxing for me to code\\nPersona: I still need to do my homework, start looking for thesis topic\\nPersona: I was procrastinating by learning flutter all day\\nPersona: Atleast its kind of cool procrastication\\nPersona: how was your weekend?\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\\nPersona: motherfucker\\nPersona: mothereater\\nPersona: ohwait you need full time\\nPersona: forgot\\nFriend: It can be half time\\nPersona: I know this song, love it\\nPersona: maybe do like petyo\\nPersona: he is applying to CBS for digital business and then if he wants to change masters, he will drop out and go to diff one in september\\nFriend: I can't deadline has past, I wanted to do same but  didn't have English exam and thought I can send them later on\\nFriend: But apparently not\\nPersona: OHH i forgot\\nPersona: I remember asking\\nPersona: ffs maybe my memory is truly fucked\\nPersona: maybe its just overloaded\\nFriend: Xddd\\nFriend: No worries it's not that relevant xf\\nPersona: I think I will watch Moon 2009\\nPersona: Will tell you if its good\\nFriend: Xdddd\\nFriend: You missed a video chat with Patryk.\\nFriend: Answer fucker\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: One of my 10 year old PC fan has finally entered its sunset era\\nPersona: and its making noise\\nPersona: unless I tilt my pc like tjis\\nPersona: So now my pc is on the edge\\nPersona: Xdddd\\nPersona: nah thats risky\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thanks for asking\\nPersona: nice \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc34\\nFriend: would you know how to make a dating app\\nFriend: tinder style\\nPersona: If I wanted I could learn to make any app\\nPersona: whats your idea?\\nFriend: do youu think i can learn it too?\\nFriend: i just had an idea to make a tinder style app for riders and horses bc we talked abt how shit all the sales sites are\\nFriend: we pay 100euros for a 6 month post of a horse\\nFriend: and the provider of the website dont do shit and the sites are so outdated\\nPersona: and is the market for that big? How many posts monthly do you assume are there?\\nPersona: do you like coding?\\nFriend: yeah it is idk how many but i would assume for 1 website called eurodressage that is pretty famouns maybe 50\\nFriend: but idk i would have to ask the administre\\nFriend: no but i could learn to like it\\nPersona: When you say tinder like app, you mean that it has matching / swiping mechanic? or we are talking about a dba like app?\\nPersona: but anyways, its not very important\\nPersona: 50 posts a month, maybe 100 - 200 if you can beat all competition is something that doesn't sound like an obvious business case immediately, it may be though\\nFriend: i feel like a swiping mechanic would be pretty good. So people get a little preview of the horses. Problem is that people post a picture of their horses face on the \u201cfront\u201d of the post but that doesent tell u anything. So swiping and then a \u201creel\u201d type preview would be so good\\nPersona: Honestly, are you more insterested in making this app happen (and additionally making money from it), or you are more interested in the learning process of coding an app?\\nFriend: and then fx when we scout horses in the netherlands it would be amazing to have the tinder function where u could set a preference in terms of do age and level and then swipe for horses close to your location\\nFriend: can i be interested in both?\\nPersona: It sounds fun, the logic behind it is probably not hard. You are looking at a front-end UI design, database and a pretty simple backend. The algorithm for the matching is probably not going to be very complex too.\\nPersona: It may be a bit advanced on animations and making that 'its a match' tinder like feeling\\nFriend: mostly the first part bc i think it would take me some time to learn to code for real but i would really like to learn it tho. \nNot necessarily be super super good but i would love to be able to actually use it in practice\\nPersona: You can, but if really what you want is to learn coding and app development, then go ahead, do it, learn to code. I can recommend a good course how to develop iOS and android apps at the same time with Flutter.\\nPersona: If actually what you want is to make this app happen, then start by validating the market and need thoroughly, before you start putting your time and money into it. The next step in that case I would recommend it to apply for CSE, where you can have business development sessions with nice experts, which give you good guidance what to do next, how to validate the business case, and proceed with making it happen. If the business case proves to be big enough, you could hire a developer that would make you such an app, given that you are pretty busy already, and someone also needs to do the commercial aspects of the business.\\nPersona: When I say 'do it, learn to code' I mean do the app while learning to code.\\nPersona: The course by the way, is around 40 hours, not expensive. but its possible to get for free\\nPersona: I took it and its a really good one. The teacher makes a few apps while teaching, which include a marketplace app, a chatting and some other smaller apps.\\nPersona: You seem to be talking about making apps again and again, so it seems like you have this interests and if you decide to learn app dev and can give it some time in your schedule, I think you can do it.\\nPersona: just call me when you on laptop, I am making it already \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: oh i didn\u2019t see your text just had dinner i\u2019ll call u in 5 if you\u2019re still working on it\\nFriend: victoriabd@live.dk\\nPersona: your wifi might be gone\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: vic, my festival casual, perhaps you a have air pump for inflatable mattress to lend for two days?\\nFriend: just had a look around the farm and actually no i don\u2019t\\nFriend: i found 1 but it\u2019s humongous i don\u2019t think it can even be in my trunk\\nPersona: humomgus xddd\\nPersona: made me grin\\nPersona: But thanks for checking\\nPersona: this parking\\nPersona: parked there many times\\nPersona: you have the permit right?\\nFriend: okay great thanks!\\nFriend: yes\\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet"

Mutation is the only way currently to make new gene codes which lead to variation. Survival challenge allows natural selection of more optimal gene codes, therefore its naturally forever optimizing\\nPersona: That explain why we 1) want to fuck 2) take unselfish care of our children\\nPersona: If some individual does noy want to fuck due to gene mutation, they may have a higher fitness score, but that will not be reproduced further\\nPersona: And while the 2nd thing is not as fundamental as the 1st one, selfisly caring for your children is extremely optimal, as species with that gene present significantly incr\u0119ase the chance of their species to continue existing\\nPersona: We therefore are optimized naturally to reproduce\\nPersona: stuff like happiness, art, etc. is just and intermediary\\nPersona: This could be a twist, since the very fundamental.part of reproduction is not neccesary then\\nPersona: probably in some hundreds of year we will not want sex that much\\nPersona: selflessly*\\nPersona: Another question whether there is a meaning to optimizing itself idk\\nPersona: Our lives might be meaningful parts of a meaningless Life optimization function.\\nPersona: bro ignore that, I changed my mind xd\\nFriend: Why\\nFriend: We gotta talk life algorthm some point\\nFriend: Maybe high\nMaybenot\\nPersona: Okay I dont think what I said is wrong, but I think this is just the foundation level, which only applies to very early species and not homo sapiens.\\nPersona: The reason is because as species got more and more fit through the means of genetics, the have increased their ability to build capital. And I think capital in abstract terms is the relevant factor here.\\nPersona: Capital would be something that last more than a single generation. For example knowledge is capital.\\nPersona: And capital is actually another way of increasing fitness of species\\nPersona: So the two ways of increasing fitness 1) genetical mutation 2) capital\\nPersona: And homo sapiens has come to the point where fitness is grown faster using capital than genetical mutation\\nPersona: Genetical mutations take a lot of iterations, and when human life span is increasing (fitness), geneetical advancement is getting slower and slower\\nPersona: but capital advancement is super fast at this point\\nPersona: Genetical advancement is almost irrelevant now\\nPersona: Things like desire for sex, binge eating is the leftover residue\\nPersona: Which was effective back in the day, when capital was low\\nPersona: Thus reproduction as the meaning of life is very very sub-optimal since while atm reproduction is still essential, but it has extremely big diminishing returns. Compared to building capital which have been showing exponential effect latelt\\nPersona: Raising 10 kids instead of 2 will barelly have marginal added value these days\\nPersona: But inventing cures for diseases for example will increase our fitness\\nPersona: And the concept of 'life' or 'being alive', or even being made out of carbon may not even a fundamental thing.\\nPersona: The algorhythm of genetical mutations can have easy analogies in computer system now, thanks to the built up capital. Thus growth in fitness can happen even without the carbon based individuals.\\nPersona: This is what happends beyond technological singularity\\nPersona: Even at this point, when the number of carbon based individual decrease, optimization will continue to happen. The, what now is hard to label, but lets call it \"the state\" will continue to grow its chances of survival (fitness). And probably will eventually end up even in a different form than 'electricity based state'.\\nPersona: So its just a travelling impulse in the universe the changes its shape\\nPersona: Evolutionary mechanism is not even a fundamental part of it.\\nPersona: Evolutionary mechanism as a way to increase fitness did not go extint yet, but its now inferior to capital as a way to increase fitness\\nPersona: basically, idk where I am going with this\\nPersona: But we are basically apart of the 'carbon based state', at the point where capital is the superios way of increasing fitness. We could say we are in the transition to maybe 'electricity based state', where machines take over naturally.\\nPersona: dammn bro\\nPersona: wtf\\nPersona: Makes me feel so little\\nPersona: But lets add death\\nPersona: Im the early carbon based era, when genetical.advancement was superior, death could have been important because it allowed for natural selection. It was a filter for fit genomes. The only way to increase fitness was with compound reproduction, thus old generations were basically useless. Not only were they useless, but also anti-productive as in our carbon era, the carbon energy is limited and overpopulation makes is harder for new genomes to grow. Thus death of old genomes was optimal. Death as optimal.\\nPersona: these days however, while we are still carbon based, genetical growth is no longer the superior method. Thus this crosses out the statement about \"old generation are useless\", that held true before. Even if we are 10 gen behind and we live 1000 years, we can still build capital.\n\nLimited carbon energy is still a factor though, but its unknown whether the cost of extra carbon energy consumed by older individuals is more than added capital advancement from old individuals.\n\nBefore there was a typeof aging \"generational aging\", which is that your repoduction becomes more and more useless as more compound generations are born. This resulted in the natural development of 'biological aging', like I sad before as it was optimal.\\nPersona: But right now generational aging is insigfificant, thus the underlying reason of biological aging is gone.\\nPersona: Its possible though that its still.optimal because old brains tend to be less innovative, less explorative and thus contribute less to capital. Or even have negative effect on capital.\\nPersona: We no longer need reproduction for fitness growth, thus we may be able to have fitness growth without death as we can get rid of overpopulation by not reproducing (or reproducing at a rate = increase in carbon energy generation capacity)\\nPersona: But young people may however have higher contributions to capital though, due to neuroplasticity. So death may still be optimal.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\\nFriend: we were just having drinks and playing board games until 6 in the morning\\nFriend: how was yours?\\nPersona: the fireworks weren't that good here haha, I was also home\\nPersona: I had literallly the most chill too\\nPersona: I felt a bit sick so stayed home, talked with friends on discord\\nPersona: So I am alive and healthy today, apart from having an inverse daynight cycle for the past wekk\\nFriend: oh god, I'm so sick of those. it felt like going through a war zone when I was biking to the dorm from home\\nFriend: aw shame I didn't know. you could've joined us\\nFriend: glad it's nothing serious. you're coming back to school already or you're having a longer Christmas break?\\nPersona: isn't the bass you feel in your chest after an explosion kind of thrilling to you?\\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\\nPersona: give me a sec\\nPersona: some ideas\\nPersona: topics rather\\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Planning\\nFriend: And coming\\nPersona: \ud83d\udda4\\nPersona: tell me when you depart from your home\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: yo\\nPersona: can you take some butter\\nPersona: and spices\\nFriend: Butter\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: What spices\\nPersona: for potato\\nPersona: umm\\nPersona: Vegeta\\nPersona: do you have?\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nPersona: idk take a bunch of spices you have. Smtg like paprika, basil, ground chilli\\nPersona: all good\\nPersona: hmm butter may get melted\\nPersona: maybr its better to buy it\\nPersona: Ohhh\\nPersona: can you take alluminum foil?\\nPersona: did you take?\\nFriend: Ni\\nFriend: Butter and spices ye\\nFriend: Gonna melt ye\\nPersona: okay so take butter\\nPersona: at store\\nPersona: did you take spices from home?\\nPersona: if not, ask Deividas\\nFriend: Yes\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: hey man\\nPersona: how r you?\\nPersona: Sorry if I got too drunk yesterday\\nPersona: I heard you were a little sad later? Whats on your mind?\\nPersona: yo, you want to bbq at Arijans\\nFriend: Hey whatsup \ud83d\ude04\\nFriend: A little\n\nI just had a long hard day and some responsibilities \n\nBut imo all is good\nCan't always have everything easy\\nFriend: The whole get outs turned out kinda nice in the end\\nPersona: Yeah it was great\\nPersona: you gotta manage econ and fun july at the same time, thats hard\\nFriend: turns out exam is friday\nim gonna no life study now\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: thats tough\\nPersona: goodluck\\nPersona: idk how it turned our very randomly, when I asked about the movie Laura recomended me, but what do you think about a movie night with laura and amanda?\\nPersona: also idk if you know but I slept over Amanda that night\\nPersona: didnt smash though, sometimes I wish we did xdd\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: And anything that has a time i try to immediately put in the calendar so i can keep track of life\\nPersona: I been experimenting with notion for a while and idk, it does not stick to me\\nPersona: Whole day I was researching note taking apps\\nPersona: I feel it takes very long to make notes in Notion and having everything on many pages, things get lost and navigation takes time.\\nPersona: Also I like the toggleable bullet list approach that MindManager for example uses\\nPersona: Its hard for me to write in paragraph style\\nPersona: I am experimenting with Obsidian and Logseq\\nPersona: Obsidian is super cool, but its paragraph style\\nPersona: Loqseq is bullet point style\\nPersona: I watched note-taking, seconds brain apps for whole video and there was no mention of Mindmanager\\nPersona: I might be too uses to it now, its really hard to switch. I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\\nPersona: yo wtf\\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\\nPersona: click the three dots\\nPersona: and there is install app button\\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\\nPersona: thats pretty cool\\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\\nPersona: and mortgages\\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\\nPersona: this is from a book\\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\\nPersona: And things get interesting then\\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\\nPersona: but hmm\\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\\nFriend: to help you get there?\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\\nPersona: Need to fix that\\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: the benefit of that place I'm talking to is that they are really well connected to everyone else in the city and collab a lot\\nPersona: If you are comparing part-time hourly wage vs full-time wage, then yes, part-timer who has finished her masters is a deal, almost a robbery. If the hourly wages are somewhat equal, then, at least in the industry, I think companies prefer full-time employees, cause they learn faster, are there all the time, less relative management costs\\nFriend: so if they don't want me long-term maybe I could weasel my way in somewhere else\\nPersona: but again, I have no clue how it is in academia, you just opened my eyes\\nPersona: totally agree\\nPersona: and it even pays off in the end. If you do something you really life, its almost impossible not to do it well, and if you do well, you aquire great negotiation power\\nPersona: jesus, the science world seems really broke when you say that\\nPersona: truly, connections will indeed give you that weaseling power\\nFriend: except it's not really in their interest to teach me that well. academia people don't stay in one place for long. research assistant role is usually fixed 1 year, phd is 3, after that you'd do one or a couple of post docs with 2 years each. it's all project-based\\nFriend: haven't seen it. must give it a watch. looks promising haha\\nFriend: fingers crossed that's the case\\nPersona: okay then it could make more sense if its short-term\\nFriend: oh boy, here they are swimming in money compared to how it looks in PL. I'm always so shocked because what they get here from Lundbeck and such in 1 year is what a Polish lab would get in 10\\nFriend: I just somehow need to become a super cool and likeable goddess of networking very fast haha. an appropriate wikihow tutorial is needed asap\\nPersona: then why are you so anxious about asking them for the compensation that you deserve? \ud83e\uddd0\\nPersona: just do more of the lying, pitbuill, pivko ritual. I am sure it will make you a networking god in no time\\nPersona: goddes*\\nPersona: goddess* (edited)\\nPersona: *literally my most pathetic typo correction in life*\\nFriend: precisely because I started my career in that culture, and that's what I'm used to\\nFriend: also, I'm starting Danish classes on the 19th. can't wait to torture everyone with my broken Danish\\nPersona: which module?\\nPersona: then go take whats yours queen \ud83d\udc51\\nPersona: I just did a month ago. Few people got salary increases, yet I asked for a really fat raise, as a part-timer, and they had to pay me, I made it clear I was not fooling around\\nFriend: 1st lol. I never dared to try\\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\\nPersona: I can be your test rat\\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\\nFriend: and we measure the difference\\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\\nFriend: who said that's desired?\\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\\nFriend: well, was worth a try \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\\nPersona: that is a cool way. Cant you also be your own study subject? I will randomize the piwko for you\\nPersona: the its n=2\\nPersona: But why not? I want both fancy, what do you mean?\\nPersona: Our language is oldest european, so they stole from us \ud83e\udd78\\nPersona: that is true\\nPersona: somehow\\nPersona: I remember back in highschool I had the desperate friends, with whom I drank sometimes and they were really seeking for tips how to get drunk cheapest. Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society\\nPersona: You know these magical tilted, or inversed rooms, where things are glue to the ground and the the room is tilted, so it looks like normal one, but when you walk on semingly flat ground, you are going on a strong incline? Maybe that could be a great start\\nFriend: that's unethical. as you can see, I care about ethics very much\\nFriend: oh, are you? that means that we evolve in the direction of fewer fancy letters over time. now that's sad. keep your fancy letters the\\nFriend: then*\\nFriend: oh yeah I was that person. tough we used to drink the legendary sulfur-loaded wine Amarena in old bunkers instead of going to school. I bet every dumb thing I've done in my life can be traced back to brain damage induced by that luxury beverage\\nFriend: it's like 7-8kr per bottle\\nFriend: and we also call the moonshine samogon (or more commonly bomber), though it was more of an 80s thing\\nFriend: keep in mind that during my experiments I need to maintain low social battery, so everyone pisses me off. no one's safe\\nFriend: are you sponsored by some straw company? I'm getting suspicious\\nFriend: excellent. everything is going as planned\\nFriend: yeah, it crossed my mind as well, but then your feet are still on the ground so it's not perfect. we need a chair\\nFriend: I also considered shooting people into space or sending them on a weightless flight, but I'm not sure how I feel about that yet\\nFriend: bimber* not bomber \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: some of them are of very very trivial utility I think, while being a super common typo and mistake source\\nPersona: like there should be no \u0105, just a.\\nPersona: Or no \u0173, just u and \u016b is enough\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: oh wait nvm\\nPersona: I thought you texted me, but I was just reading an old message xddd\\nPersona: what is the table with LLMs you always bring up?\\nFriend: Chatbot arena leadberboard\\nFriend: At huggingface\\nPersona: ncie thx\\nPersona: Tuesday 8 AM he invited for a meeting\\nFriend: perfect\\nFriend: I added some guys in the docs from SI\\nPersona: I sent to chriatianr\\nPersona: lovely\\nPersona: we do the template first, or targeted?\\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\\nPersona: why not idea 3?\\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\\nFriend: Don't stress it\\nPersona: i think i agree with you\\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nPersona: I wrote in green\\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nPersona: So will skip him\\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nPersona: Dont add topic 2\\nPersona: for all\\nPersona: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nPersona: more targeted will get better response rates\\nPersona: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nFriend: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nPersona: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nPersona: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: holy shit xD that's rimworld or realworld\\nPersona: I also never properly done things with Biotech dlc, its official content so high quolity\\nPersona: it allows gene engineerging, mechanoid building\\nPersona: babies\\nPersona: well I had babies inevitably\\nPersona: but never went into advanced mode with them\\nPersona: there are growrh capsules to speed their growing\\nPersona: As they grow you are able to partially influence their traits, passions\\nPersona: and it you got gene engineering tech, you could gene engineer them to be extra adapted to your environment\\nPersona: then there is also Ideologies. I always play classic style idealogies, but you can get a whole new game if you build, evolve or changr to a different one\\nPersona: f.e. you could be cannibbal slaver\\nPersona: that requires you to have slaves, do executions and consume human meat\\nPersona: (required as in peope will be unhappy and have mental breaks)\\nFriend: oh yeah you said there is canibalism\n\nbut what if you can't find other  people to eat, do you have to make babies and eat your own ppl\\nPersona: you would also be benefitted from having blood, skulls visible everywhere\\nPersona: xdd, I think you can still eat other food in a pinch\\nFriend: ah\\nPersona: but you can raid other bases\\nFriend: eww.. food xD\\nPersona: and eat them\\nPersona: lol\\nPersona: but canibalistic meme is just one of many\\nPersona: there is like a meme (ideology trait) that says blindness is sacred\\nPersona: so basically you fo ceremononies whete you remove eyes of your own colonists\\nPersona: and then everyone lives blind\\nPersona: so you would have to resort to melee combat, animal etc to fight for you I guess. Or build turrets\\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute. If they unfreeeze for a while, say a raid penetrates your base or a unaticipated heatwave heats it up, you will get poluttion in your map and it could be a lot you will need hazmat gear to just survive and clean it up.\\nPersona: you could send the pollutioj away via transport pods to your enemies tho\\nPersona: that will make them real angry and they will send raids to you\\nPersona: there are also sangophuages - pretty much vampires that can live forever but have to drink blood - can be harvested regularly from prisoners\\nPersona: There is also luciferium, a drug I never dares to take. It makea you instantly addicted to it and then if you dont consume it regularly, you will die. However it could overtime heal up otherwise unhealable injury, including permanent ones.\\nPersona: insane\\nFriend: sounds like a good last resort for units that are low\\nFriend: can you not stack it up so you have for that unit for a while_\\nFriend: and are there some ways that unit can be of good value thanks to that unique circumstance?\n\nLike if it will die anyway, good for recon operation maybe or something where death is high chance\n\nor maybe it can pass on knowledge or something\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: You can get a shot in the head and suffer from a permanent brain injury of some type\\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype"

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nFriend: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nPersona: I'll show you next time we meet\\nPersona: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nPersona: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient.

With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too.

Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I don't think we ever played Factorio together\\nPersona: But the tower defence one is fun\\nFriend: Ok its the tower def\nBut same as factorio\\nFriend: Factory building\\nPersona: Yup\\nPersona: I am down today I guess, then I go to poland\\nFriend: Im destroyed\\nFriend: Idk if i can be high functional\\nPersona: Cause Wednesday is contingent on this swimming plan, but from the vibes in the group chat not sure is it going to happen\\nPersona: yeah you need some sleep\\nFriend: If chill game im down for duo\\nPersona: I mean, if you decide to, I am free\\nPersona: I would also love to show you Rimworld sometime for real, its a fascinating game\\nFriend: I am gonna cook and chill if you wanna hang out\nIdk what i feel like doing\\nPersona: You home?\\nFriend: Wanna show me?\\nFriend: Omw\\nPersona: Okay then, I will do some laundry and finish watching a movie and then I will come\\nFriend: Deal\\nPersona: Do you mind buying Rimworld off steam for I think 25$.

Like just simple ones, not lucid?\\nPersona: that is so low\\nPersona: did you again dodge an invitation to do something in real life? \ud83d\ude44\\nPersona: I may need to do you ritual tommorow, its monthly friday bar at work, but this time its a special one cause one of the better collueages has his birthday.\\nPersona: and my company is really social. like it's too social for me\\nPersona: have any tips on doing the ritual at work?\\nFriend: this looks like an oldschoold perm dryer\\nFriend: give it a few months and you'll be able to do it yourself\\nFriend: it is. I only realized that while I was thinking about that lucid dream thing\\nFriend: I don't really miss much. I do have a vivid imagination\\nFriend: oopsie sorry, that one was accidental. I was focused on the sword art, and didn't even realize\\nFriend: I guess I've mastered the art of people dodgeball a bit too well\\nFriend: hm back at the hospital I used to go to the trip room (the room where we put patients after giving them psychedelics). it had a bed and everything. very nice\\nFriend: so my advice would be - find the trip room\\nPersona: u have a trip room there xddd\\nFriend: we sure do\\nFriend: even stayed there overnight once\\nFriend: sadly not tripping\\nPersona: yeah, its a pretty trivial part of life. But sometimes its interesting what your mind puts you into, especially when it chooses peolple\\nPersona: Just today I can recall 2 dreams I head\\nPersona: neither fun, neither nightmares. More less fun than fun, I think I save myself in nightmare situations by just dealing with them. I never dream of the cliche demons, etc.\\nPersona: My most common nightmare is brake not working on a car\\nPersona: and the inteteresting thing is that everytime it happens, the car is going slow, usually in a parking lot and i am freaked out of denting someone elses car and mostlt having an awkward situation\\nPersona: idk id I should try to understand its meaning\\nPersona: if*\\nPersona: you sure did\\nPersona: Does the hospital give out free psychadelics, or what tha hell? Please explain!\\nPersona: Also I imagined the room way different\\nPersona: I thought its going to be one of those jamaican vibe, with plants everywhere and everything colorful\\nFriend: I think that's even worse than demons, because this can translate into real life anxiety\\nFriend: the dreams I remember the most are about going through a plane crash, or a car exploding with my dad inside, etc., so idk, my brain is a bit too dramatic\\nFriend: okay, let's fix this. how busy from very busy to super extra busy are you in the foreseeable future?\\nFriend: oh yeah, they give psilocybin to healthy people, unhealthy people, pigs, rats, whatever they can put their hands on\\nFriend: though don't get too excited. there are usually some cognitive tests involved so I think you need to be Danish to qualify\\nFriend: but if you have some Danish friends who'd like to contribute to science of tripping:\\nPersona: well, at least I dont have the thing where I am afraid someone from below the bed will grab my out of bed bounds arm\\nPersona: I cant imagine living with that\\nPersona: could you be afraid of flying?\\nPersona: I love the range of choices xdd\\nPersona: I would say very busy \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: relax time is a small neccesity of being sustainably very busy though\\nPersona: science of tripping \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: have you been ever tripping in that tripping room?\\nFriend: or sleep paralysis. ugh. I don't think I would ever sleep if I had that\\nFriend: oh yeah\\nFriend: that's embarrassing\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: i\u2019ll dress out as a drug dealer then i\u2019ll be fine\\nPersona: why?

Or what game?\\nPersona: Rimworld?\\nFriend: Haven't tried that i think\\nPersona: Rimworld is the planet game :))\\nFriend: No \nLike couch joystick co ip\\nFriend: Really\\nPersona: oh yeah, down for lan parties anytime\\nPersona: thats a planet\\nFriend: No\nNot played this ever\n\nThe one with conveyor belts\\nPersona: about more ppl, idk haven't talked about games with much people. But I know Marcus is a gamer, he might be down\\nPersona: Patryk is in Poland\\nPersona: Toby in netherlands\\nPersona: Oh Factorio? Or the tower defence one?\\nFriend: Think si\\nFriend: Si\\nFriend: So\\nPersona: Which one?\\nPersona: I think we played the tower defence one\\nPersona: I don't think we ever played Factorio together\\nPersona: But the tower defence one is fun\\nFriend: Ok its the tower def\nBut same as factorio\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\\nPersona: I can be your test rat\\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\\nFriend: and we measure the difference\\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\\nFriend: who said that's desired?\\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\\nFriend: well, was worth a try \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\\nPersona: that is a cool way. Cant you also be your own study subject? I will randomize the piwko for you\\nPersona: the its n=2\\nPersona: But why not? I want both fancy, what do you mean?\\nPersona: Our language is oldest european, so they stole from us \ud83e\udd78\\nPersona: that is true\\nPersona: somehow\\nPersona: I remember back in highschool I had the desperate friends, with whom I drank sometimes and they were really seeking for tips how to get drunk cheapest. Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society\\nPersona: You know these magical tilted, or inversed rooms, where things are glue to the ground and the the room is tilted, so it looks like normal one, but when you walk on semingly flat ground, you are going on a strong incline? Maybe that could be a great start\\nFriend: that's unethical. as you can see, I care about ethics very much\\nFriend: oh, are you? that means that we evolve in the direction of fewer fancy letters over time. now that's sad. keep your fancy letters the\\nFriend: then*\\nFriend: oh yeah I was that person. tough we used to drink the legendary sulfur-loaded wine Amarena in old bunkers instead of going to school. I bet every dumb thing I've done in my life can be traced back to brain damage induced by that luxury beverage\\nFriend: it's like 7-8kr per bottle\\nFriend: and we also call the moonshine samogon (or more commonly bomber), though it was more of an 80s thing\\nFriend: keep in mind that during my experiments I need to maintain low social battery, so everyone pisses me off. no one's safe\\nFriend: are you sponsored by some straw company? I'm getting suspicious\\nFriend: excellent. everything is going as planned\\nFriend: yeah, it crossed my mind as well, but then your feet are still on the ground so it's not perfect. we need a chair\\nFriend: I also considered shooting people into space or sending them on a weightless flight, but I'm not sure how I feel about that yet\\nFriend: bimber* not bomber \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: some of them are of very very trivial utility I think, while being a super common typo and mistake source\\nPersona: like there should be no \u0105, just a.\\nPersona: Or no \u0173, just u and \u016b is enough\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: how long are you planing to drive around\\nPersona: until 21 maybe\\nFriend: aaa\\nFriend: i think i will stay home\\nPersona: oooo online together. I like the idea. Civ is good, I got like 50hrs so I know how to operate bur I am pretty nub\\nPersona: I would really like to play some Minecraft with Create modpack. Its basically the new very popular technology mod in mc that reinvented the whole concept of how automation is done in minecraft. It is now a much more minecrafty feeling and involves a more interesting challenge.\\nPersona: I set aside a week for gaming during christmas period\\nPersona: I have a different point of view like I said, but I agree on the relationship part, good point\\nPersona: and the way I practically interpret this is that I should try to not blame myself for not sticking to my plan sometimes due to unplanned moments involving other ppl and relationships.\\nPersona: actually I wrote some tests today, because I have to deisign an internal system, but idk if I am doing it according to standards. I would be very intesrested in learning with you therefore\\nPersona: maybe we can look at it tommorow\\nPersona: dont really know the bpmn diagram standard, from first look appears like a process flowchart. I did some UML diagrams tho, have some experience in that\\nPersona: yeah Tekkit is the OG one, it evolved so much\\nPersona: but its no longer the shit, there are much newer ones\\nPersona: Also its a bit of a nerdy game to play, idk what kind of gamer you are. I am a obsessive gamer, so I will nolife a modpack for a whole week and then not play it ever again xddd\\nPersona: we can do it before or after bouldering\\nPersona: adventure hardcore modpacks are fun too. I liked blood n bones a lot. RL craft is now next popular one, but I have mixed view on it\\nPersona: there are combinatioms of tech and adventure\\nPersona: damn man\\nFriend: [*] Shary\\nFriend: Rest in peace\\nFriend: Am I doing that properly? Xd\\nPersona: what is this?\\nFriend: shary\\nPersona: Oh, i cant really see anything in the video mate\\nFriend: i created an account but it seems like there is nothing for this master program\\nPersona: unfortunately then :(\\nFriend: Is it possible that I'm using the system wrongly?\\nPersona: Hmm i dont know how you are using it\\nPersona: There mighr just not be anything for thia program\\nPersona: also its hard to use this system wrongly\\nPersona: adblock war intensifies\\nPersona: my adblock still works no prob\\nPersona: hvidovre boulders is so fucking far\\nFriend: Take petyo and goooooo\\nPersona: My car is at aunts place so yeah\\nPersona: I am taking a 1hr bus and then the will take my car on the way back\\nFriend: Shishh\\nFriend: That's a sacrifice \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: The bus trip is a nice relax\\nFriend: can't wait to se yoou <333\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Poor guy\\nFriend: No more jacking\\nFriend: For next week\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude1e\\nFriend: I can jack for you\\nPersona: I knew I could always rely on you strong hands \ud83d\ude07\\nPersona: your*\\nPersona: alse look ig message\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I cant Thurday, I am having last day at work and then certification event at CSE \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: What about others?\\nFriend: I can't really do thursday but am free friday outside of class\\nPersona: Friday after class I am also good\\nFriend: Ok let\u2019s do Friday\\nFriend: What time tho ?\\nFriend: I have a call at 2\\nFriend: After class?\\nFriend: Hmm how long will we meet for ?

Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish.

Or even have negative effect on capital.\\nPersona: We no longer need reproduction for fitness growth, thus we may be able to have fitness growth without death as we can get rid of overpopulation by not reproducing (or reproducing at a rate = increase in carbon energy generation capacity)\\nPersona: But young people may however have higher contributions to capital though, due to neuroplasticity. So death may still be optimal.\\nPersona: lol I should stop\\nPersona: I wrote a whole essay here\\nFriend: Fitness setting (current gene) iskinda like knowledge but different\n\nCapital too\\nPersona: I dont get what you mean\\nPersona: Idk bro, I keep changing my opinions\\nPersona: maybe fitness is no longer survival rn\\nPersona: There might be no generally aplicable abstract truth.We are just pieces of predetermined matter in motion\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude16\\nFriend: i think fitness still survival\\nFriend: but we are able to use something more than evolutionary reaction and randomness to survival\\nPersona: what is evolutionary r\u0119action?\\nFriend: cause\\nFriend: the tool for survival of things\\nFriend: is \"make as many of us as possible\"\\nFriend: and let randomness decide whats good\\nPersona: Yeah thats one iteration\\nPersona: Then the dominant one gets to replicate most\\nFriend: but with societal structures and knowledge it changes a bit\\nFriend: and its more like which society is better kind of\\nFriend: but I feel like we can't afford at this stage to let things run it's course and \"test\"\n\nyou either make it or die\n\nlike with things coming into the far future like inevitable sun death \n\nor maybe meteor hitting earth\\nPersona: Genetica I think became almost irrelevant. Its took billions of years. We just took 4000 years to double peoplea life expectancy\\nPersona: Using capital\\nPersona: I lost you there\\nPersona: Testing with death as an answer is no longer relevant\\nPersona: mutations are slow and take thousands of yearz\\nFriend: as in, now it's less evolution on the human level\n\nit's more on the structure that humans are\\nFriend: like a humans evolution is less about the evolution of it's cells\n\nit's more about the evolution of the environment and system that sets up those cells\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: so humans maybe are more irrelevant in the big picture and a big organism made of humans is forming\\nPersona: Agree\\nPersona: But what is the meaning of one concious indicidual then?\\nFriend: but depending on the perspective you could argue there aren't many organisms of humans\n\nlike currently there are. Countries and what not\nand you have some thriving better\n\nbut interstellar wise its just 1 colony\\nFriend: and if its just 1 organism\n\nand it dies\n\ngame over\\nPersona: yeah maybe its smth bigger\\nPersona: But our progress is a bit isolates though\\nPersona: rn its only on earth pretty much ( well technically our solar system maybe )\\nPersona: we were optimized there in isolation\\nPersona: we are not yet competing with anyone else\\nFriend: yeah\nits more relevant to \"the creation of the first organism\"\\nFriend: how tf did the first one survive\\nFriend: it probably didnt\\nPersona: it didnt until a random arrangement allowed it to replicate\\nPersona: probably\\nFriend: holy fuck xD the first ever organism and you are sitting there like \"wtf. Where is my splitting ability\"\\nFriend: soo uh yeah.. hoomans are probably doomed but maybe not\\nPersona: Even if that organism could survive, if it coulnd replicate, it would.not continue"

With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty.

Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too.

Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like."
