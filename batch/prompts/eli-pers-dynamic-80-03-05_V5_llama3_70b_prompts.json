Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient.

What do u think about that?\\nFriend: ok wait, I'll review them\\nFriend: why not idea 3?\\nFriend: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nPersona: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nPersona: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nFriend: ok I am checking them rn\\nFriend: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nFriend: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nFriend: I had one chance and I took it\\nPersona: Don't stress it\\nFriend: i think i agree with you\\nFriend: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nFriend: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nFriend: I wrote in green\\nFriend: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nPersona: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nFriend: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nFriend: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nPersona: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Like 50\\nPersona: I\u2019ll just add u 2 the group\\nFriend: okay\\nPersona: Do u have mobile pay?\\nFriend: Yes\\nPersona: What\u2019s your number?\\nFriend: Where do I find that\\nPersona: It\u2019s your phone number\\nFriend: 53809977\\nPersona: It says no account has that number\\nFriend: 53809967\\nFriend: That\u2019s the correct number\\nFriend: could u send me the books\\nPersona: Sure.

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it. If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?"

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

What do u think about that?\\nFriend: ok wait, I'll review them\\nFriend: why not idea 3?\\nFriend: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nPersona: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nPersona: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nFriend: ok I am checking them rn\\nFriend: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nFriend: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nFriend: I had one chance and I took it\\nPersona: Don't stress it\\nFriend: i think i agree with you\\nFriend: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nFriend: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nFriend: I wrote in green\\nFriend: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nPersona: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nFriend: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nFriend: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nPersona: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good.

Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\\nPersona: Forgot it was exercise class\\nFriend: umm\\nFriend: Yeha if you are at cbs?\\nPersona: I\u2019m nearby, at station\\nPersona: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\\nFriend: damb what are you doing?"

Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: He never got a reply from Dan\\nFriend: Dan Hardt\\nFriend: Ohfuck\\nFriend: I mean Daniel\\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\\nPersona: I see\\nFriend: Yeah sorry\\nFriend: I confused the names\\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it. If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

I only went 2 half of them\\nPersona: If yes, do u have notes from sessions/lectures: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 that you'd like 2 share?:) I have the rest in markdown or pdf\\nFriend: yeah will send in a bit\\nFriend: thats my whole mmap\\nFriend: feels good to send note to some1 without haveing to explain wtf I just sent\\nFriend: notes*\\nPersona: I know what u mean!\\nPersona: I saw u didn't have notes from L5, where I was in class\\nFriend: thanks man\\nPersona: ofc:)\\nFriend: I missed this case\\nFriend: will be interesting to read\\nFriend: Elias, you @ egment now?\\nPersona: No. Im at a camp on fyn\\nFriend: ahhh okay\\nFriend: have fun\\nPersona: Thx! What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: My best looking brother \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: Hahahah, my time-management is soooo bad \ud83d\ude01\\nFriend: I will be available if u find time\\nFriend: U sound very busy\\nFriend: I just woke up.

That could help them :)\\nFriend: The next guest or Phil can just wash them\\nFriend: You can leave the sheets on\\nFriend: Hahahaha, watched the videos\\nFriend: Hmhmhm, you can leave them in our mailbox and the key for the mailbox on top of it \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Ah Alisa was texting me: u leaving at 4 tmrw morning\\nFriend: It\u2019s Paul-Robeson-Stra\u00dfe 36.

This way, you could at least have feedback for the next paper/re-exam :)\\nFriend: I see, the analysis is always the hardest, I\u2019d say. \ud83d\ude0c but maybe you don\u2019t have to be so \u201econcrete\u201c?

I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\\nPersona: Would appreciate that<3\\nFriend: The sheet at the end are not really templates\\nFriend: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\\nFriend: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\\nFriend: sheets*\\nPersona: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\\nFriend: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\\nPersona: Thanks bro!\\nFriend: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Pretty well.

I just arrived home safely:)\\nFriend: Hey, have you used Notion?\\nPersona: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\\nPersona: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\\nFriend: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\\nPersona: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\\nPersona: Forgot it was exercise class\\nFriend: umm\\nFriend: Yeha if you are at cbs?\\nPersona: I\u2019m nearby, at station\\nPersona: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\\nFriend: damb what are you doing?"

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also"

I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?"

As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\\nFriend: I\u2019m out atm. But gonna be back in 2h :)\\nFriend: ^Here it is. I think the structure is already better, and I have 2 take a break 2 eat now\\nFriend: Better done than perfect, honey! \ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: oki, just send it to me when you feel like sending.\\nFriend: At 11.00 tmr\\nFriend: I'm pretty flexible today. Therefore, you don't have to stress. When do you have to hand in?\\nFriend: of course :)\\nFriend: The thing I hope u can help me with is the \u201cbird vision\u201d. I feel like that\u2019s the only real struggle 4 me. Specifically, that the chronology of the paper is coherent, and that it does not jump over 2 big gaps in between paragraphs. Does it make sense?:)\\nFriend: Please don\u2019t read it yet. Only the table of content is worth to look at perhaps. I\u2019m at the visas office rn and feeling pretty stressed out.

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\\nPersona: Forgot it was exercise class\\nFriend: umm\\nFriend: Yeha if you are at cbs?\\nPersona: I\u2019m nearby, at station\\nPersona: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\\nFriend: damb what are you doing?"

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

This way, you could at least have feedback for the next paper/re-exam :)\\nFriend: I see, the analysis is always the hardest, I\u2019d say. \ud83d\ude0c but maybe you don\u2019t have to be so \u201econcrete\u201c? Maybe you can argue for whatever point you wanna make, with sources you already have?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

Should we make one too?\\nPersona: I just went home as well. I wanna sleep a bit before the tour\\nPersona: U didn't miss anything\\nPersona: Sure we could make one. Is it all of the girls in DM?\\nFriend: Probably not all of them but I thought a bigger group would be good to keep in touch\u2026\\nPersona: sure thing. But exclusively 4 boys?\\nPersona: Maybe we should just make 1 for everyone on FB?\\nFriend: No let\u2019s include girls\\nFriend: Yes\\nPersona: Let's mention it at the dinners\\nFriend: Perfect\\nFriend: When are u playing?\\nPersona: 14.00 probably\\nFriend: What bar r u going?\\nPersona: I'm about 2 leave\\nPersona: 2 meet the others\\nPersona: Idk where they're at/going tho\\nFriend: Ahh so u are going to the bar rn?\\nPersona: Idk, just wanna meet up and get drunk\\nFriend: Hahaha sounds good\\nPersona: Let's get out now\\nFriend: I\u2019ll be there in 35 min\\nPersona: You'll be late 4 a spot bro\\nFriend: Ok I\u2019m on my way\\nFriend: But I need 20 min\\nFriend: Can you save a spot for me\\nPersona: I'll do my best\\nPersona: Its lit\\nPersona: Where r u sitting?\\nFriend: In the back\\nFriend: But on my way to Cantine rn\\nPersona: What number is your study group?\\nFriend: 21\\nFriend: Where r u\\nPersona: Generally, your paragraphs are too short. It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

What do u think about that?\\nFriend: ok wait, I'll review them\\nFriend: why not idea 3?\\nFriend: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nPersona: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nPersona: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nFriend: ok I am checking them rn\\nFriend: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nFriend: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nFriend: I had one chance and I took it\\nPersona: Don't stress it\\nFriend: i think i agree with you\\nFriend: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nFriend: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nFriend: I wrote in green\\nFriend: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nPersona: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nFriend: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nFriend: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nPersona: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Jacob missed your call.\\nFriend: You missed a call from Jacob.\\nPersona: You called Jacob.\\nFriend: Dalgas have 15\\nFriend: Go on google maps\\nFriend: Should be a 10 min walk from bitlap\\nPersona: Thx\\nFriend: Did you go to the meeting today at 9?\\nPersona: No, I just arrived\\nPersona: U here?\\nFriend: No haha\\nFriend: But I\u2019ll come to the tour\\nFriend: Was just too tired in the morning\\nFriend: I know that the girls have a girls group chat.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Okay, I make note!\\nPersona: I\u2019ve updated the drive-folder I share with you\\nPersona: Can I get access 2 this map?\\nFriend: Its empty almost\\nFriend: but yeah, send me your email\\nPersona: Eliastorjani@gmail.com\\nFriend: I shared with you\\nFriend: Have you found if Aspiri thing can be shared?\\nPersona: Unfortunately not.

What do u think about that?\\nFriend: ok wait, I'll review them\\nFriend: why not idea 3?\\nFriend: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nPersona: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nPersona: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nFriend: ok I am checking them rn\\nFriend: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nFriend: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nFriend: I had one chance and I took it\\nPersona: Don't stress it\\nFriend: i think i agree with you\\nFriend: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nFriend: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nFriend: I wrote in green\\nFriend: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nPersona: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nFriend: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nFriend: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nPersona: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Lol.\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Lololll\\nPersona: This should be illegal\\nPersona: And this\\nFriend: I know\\nFriend: Lmaoooo\\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew\\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\\nFriend: Nooo\\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\\nFriend: One day I willll\\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Hiiii\\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Hello!!

I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: No, it was ridiculously unstructured as always\\nFriend: Do you get feedback for papers? This way, you could at least have feedback for the next paper/re-exam :)\\nFriend: I see, the analysis is always the hardest, I\u2019d say. \ud83d\ude0c but maybe you don\u2019t have to be so \u201econcrete\u201c? Maybe you can argue for whatever point you wanna make, with sources you already have?\\nFriend: Hm, maybe you have to think of different steps and loops you have to take to finish an essay/paper. Did you work with a writing plan?\\nFriend: I wish I could learn how 2 convert my time-mgmt mistakes 2 \u201crules\u201d 4 myself the next time, but it always seem 2 be completely new:(\\nFriend: I do\\nFriend: Already at the smoothie place tho. It\u2019s good!\\nFriend: I\u2019d rather Hand in at the re-exam (it\u2019s the same assignment) than 2 hand in smth I\u2019m not proud of. The conclusion paragraph won\u2019t be hard, it\u2019s the analysis stuff that bugs me - 2 find citations from old academics on a future topic\\nFriend: It\u2019s one of your first papers. I think, you don\u2019t have to be perfect. You can see it as a first trial, no? :) and in any case you learned a lot for the next time regarding time management and structuring stuff. :)\\nFriend: Do you have grammarly or a similar Programm? I think, it would help to let it run through something like this? :) just to have some quick fixes \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Also if you want to safe some time, you can also just go to Caf\u00e9 Kraft to work from there. Therefore, you don\u2019t have to commute.\\nFriend: Hi there \u2600\ufe0f \\nFriend: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it:/\\nFriend: 5.

Hopefully I\u2019ll meet him 4 real another time, because we didn\u2019t have time 2 talk that much\\nFriend: Btw how was the night with ur guest?\\nFriend: Maybe I have to call back because we\u2019re in the city right now. So I need few minutes to find a quite spot \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Ah no worries, I think I can manage :) I\u2019d love to hear about it\\nFriend: I was just saying that I would like 2 talk 2 u about my paper if u have time and want 2 hear about it when we call. But it\u2019s totally fine, if you\u2019re pressured w time\\nFriend: Ah your sound is kinda bad. I didn\u2019t really understood. You have to give a presentation soon?\\nFriend: I think I\u2019m not having so much time. But we could just have a quick call if u want. Or would it be better for u writing at the is time?\\nFriend: R we calling today at the usual time?\\nFriend: I\u2019ll get the stuff;)\\nFriend: Cheaper than Rewe\\nFriend: You can get everything cheap at Lidl or Aldi\\nFriend: And Backpapier we do not use so often \ud83d\ude01 so I guess it\u2019s empty \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Hahaha, I didn\u2019t really get the beginning. \\nFriend: Sorry, we\u2019re little busy driving and finding food atm\\nFriend: That\u2019s my most lovely friend.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\\nFriend: And then use the dryer\\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?"

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours.

It just seem less complicated 2 rent from a private person, when we r doing 2 different roadtrips\\nPersona: Unless, it's cheaper than renting:P\\nFriend: Ahh I get it now\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu?

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it. If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: interesting, I did not\\nFriend: I should\\nFriend: Thank you\\nPersona: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\\nFriend: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\\nFriend: I will check out your too\\nPersona: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\\nPersona: Just looked at our MCMR maps\\nPersona: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\\nFriend: Im done maaaan\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: Goodluck\\nFriend: I've got a small anki deck\\nPersona: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\\nPersona: How did it go?\\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\\nFriend: Maybe you took extra notes from slides?\\nPersona: Yes, it\u2019s nice. I was thinking about creating a big Micro calculator in excel 4 all the things we\u2019ve been through. But then Karol sort of made me rethink it, since the objective is 2 make us able 2 calculate and resonate as it is\\nPersona: Only what I did in class\\nFriend: That would take a while haha\\nFriend: Oh mee too yeah\\nPersona: Yes, and wouldn\u2019t be worth it\\nPersona: Updated CMR\\nPersona: ^Is this enough 2 say? Like r u able 2 find it, just by looking through tags?\\nFriend: ye all good\\nFriend: Same - Updated MCMR\\nPersona: I updated quite some stuff in Micro, and a little in ML\\nFriend: Hey man, thanks, I'll check it out!\\nPersona: Did a few micro notes yesterday, not anything special\\nFriend: Hey, don't delete the date tags yet for this month, I haven't copied info from yours yet\u0104\\nFriend: !*\\nPersona: I did some moving of topics\\nPersona: I didn\u2019t know how 2 show w/ tags. Let me show u after class\\nFriend: okay\\nPersona: Also, will u take a quick look at some some code which my group is struggling with?:)\\nFriend: Sure!\\nPersona: Thx\\nFriend: Mindmapping in VR\\nPersona: Yes yes yes and yes\\nPersona: ^Easy mindmap to anki conversion\\nPersona: Btw, do u have 30 min too help me with a minor machine learning problem at some point? (Preferably before noon tmr if possible):)\\nFriend: Hmm maybe\\nFriend: Whats the problem? I dont have time for a meet neither today nor tommorow as I am.working. But on Thursday I am free\\nFriend: Unless its smth quick\\nPersona: It falls under the category of parameter tuning and prediction (don\u2019t know how quick that is). What time will suit u best Thursday?\\nFriend: Maybe around afternoon 11 or 13?\\nPersona: I can do 11:)\\nFriend: Alright\\nPersona: I\u2019ll find a spot in kilen\\nPersona: No free tables. I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas\\nFriend: Yoo\\nFriend: I thouht we just call \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: Oh hahah\\nPersona: I\u2019ll just call u from here then\\nFriend: im turning on my pc\\nFriend: google meets?\\nFriend: Cant hear you\\nPersona: Where r we meeting?\\nFriend: Oh fuck.we had a meeting today??\\nFriend: I literally forgot to put on my calendar\\nFriend: where were we supposed to meet?\\nFriend: when*\\nPersona: No worries, I overslept 2\\nPersona: Also I accidentally put it at 12 instead of 10, idk why\\nPersona: Wanna move it 2 this afternoon, if u have time?\\nFriend: Would it be a problem meeting on Thursday?\\nPersona: That\u2019s cool\\nPersona: 10 at sp?\\nFriend: Okay, I make note!\\nPersona: I\u2019ve updated the drive-folder I share with you\\nPersona: Can I get access 2 this map?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: My best looking brother \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: Hahahah, my time-management is soooo bad \ud83d\ude01\\nFriend: I will be available if u find time\\nFriend: U sound very busy\\nFriend: I just woke up.

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?).

Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u\\nFriend: wait just got home, eating, will take a look very soon\\nPersona: Update on our status. Got 7*no, and I think we should send followups to Karol, Mads, Tawfiq, Timothy, and GG (each from the opposite account as the one where we send the original mail), what do u think?\\nFriend: 7no's :o\\nFriend: from how many outreaches?\\nPersona: When we submit a proposal we have 2 fill out the supervisor field.

What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\\nFriend: And then use the dryer\\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\\nFriend: Found it\\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Is Emma with you?

I only went 2 half of them\\nPersona: If yes, do u have notes from sessions/lectures: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 that you'd like 2 share?:) I have the rest in markdown or pdf\\nFriend: yeah will send in a bit\\nFriend: thats my whole mmap\\nFriend: feels good to send note to some1 without haveing to explain wtf I just sent\\nFriend: notes*\\nPersona: I know what u mean!\\nPersona: I saw u didn't have notes from L5, where I was in class\\nFriend: thanks man\\nPersona: ofc:)\\nFriend: I missed this case\\nFriend: will be interesting to read\\nFriend: Elias, you @ egment now?\\nPersona: No. Im at a camp on fyn\\nFriend: ahhh okay\\nFriend: have fun\\nPersona: Thx! What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Lol.\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Lololll\\nPersona: This should be illegal\\nPersona: And this\\nFriend: I know\\nFriend: Lmaoooo\\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew\\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\\nFriend: Nooo\\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\\nFriend: One day I willll\\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Hiiii\\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Hello!!

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend?

I feel like that\u2019s the only real struggle 4 me. Specifically, that the chronology of the paper is coherent, and that it does not jump over 2 big gaps in between paragraphs. Does it make sense?:)\\nFriend: Please don\u2019t read it yet. Only the table of content is worth to look at perhaps. I\u2019m at the visas office rn and feeling pretty stressed out. I wanna finish send you the newest draft in an hour (maybe I should put it in docs, so I don\u2019t waste transfer time, and you can see it whenever online\u2026?)\\nFriend: It's still messy.

Maybe check one of the car sharing platforms, if u want it 2 be green into the root;)\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think so. Anyways, greenwashing is just what it is until it ain\u2019t anymore.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\\nFriend: I\u2019m out atm. But gonna be back in 2h :)\\nFriend: ^Here it is. I think the structure is already better, and I have 2 take a break 2 eat now\\nFriend: Better done than perfect, honey! \ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: oki, just send it to me when you feel like sending.\\nFriend: At 11.00 tmr\\nFriend: I'm pretty flexible today. Therefore, you don't have to stress. When do you have to hand in?\\nFriend: of course :)\\nFriend: The thing I hope u can help me with is the \u201cbird vision\u201d. I feel like that\u2019s the only real struggle 4 me. Specifically, that the chronology of the paper is coherent, and that it does not jump over 2 big gaps in between paragraphs. Does it make sense?:)\\nFriend: Please don\u2019t read it yet. Only the table of content is worth to look at perhaps. I\u2019m at the visas office rn and feeling pretty stressed out. I wanna finish send you the newest draft in an hour (maybe I should put it in docs, so I don\u2019t waste transfer time, and you can see it whenever online\u2026?)\\nFriend: It's still messy.

And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Luckily I got u covered from there:)\\nFriend: Im done maaaan\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: Goodluck\\nFriend: I've got a small anki deck\\nPersona: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\\nPersona: How did it go?\\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That is way too much Nikolay, I\u2019ll invite u on a chicken date at the place in Frederiksberg when they open again\\nFriend: It\u2019s why I pay for a haircut\\nPersona: That confirms that I have to introduce u to my barber\\nPersona: Chicken today?\\nFriend: I won\u2019t be able to I think I will play football\\nFriend: With the boys\\nPersona: no worries, another day\\nFriend: Hahahah\\nFriend: How is this done\\nFriend: And it looks so silly\\nPersona: It\u2019s with a 360 camera I think\\nPersona: With a mount on the hips, but the camera makes it invisible\\nFriend: It looks so silly\\nFriend: Hahahah\\nPersona: I Think it\u2019s kind of cool\\nPersona: U live in one of these apartments?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Florensvej 14\\nFriend: Is my address.

But since u r warning me it must be bad?\\nFriend: I mean the symptoms vary a lot between people\\nFriend: In my car\\nFriend: Case\\nFriend: My skin got yellowish\\nFriend: Light headed sometimes when I get up too quickly\\nFriend: Running out of breath when running\\nFriend: Very quickly\\nPersona: Does not sound to nice\\nFriend: No\\nPersona: Did u get the operation?\\nFriend: It could also be loss of apetite, weight etc\\nFriend: I don\u2019t have any of this\\nFriend: Also tiredness\\nFriend: I had this one partially\\nFriend: Probably next week\\nFriend: Getting last check tomorrow\\nFriend: Before the actual surgery\\nPersona: Some of these side effects sounds like me. But maybe it's a coincidence\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been to the normal doctor, which have sent me to the specialist, whom I\u2019m calling tomorrow\\nPersona: Good luck with all the surgery, let me know how it goes!\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know how much blood you are loosing\\nFriend: And for how long\\nFriend: But I would\nSuggest ask for a blood test\\nFriend: And check your levels of hemoglobin\\nPersona: I actually had a blood test (unrelated to this) I'll check the haemoglobin now\\nFriend: I got a phone call directly after mine\\nFriend: And they asked me if I am still alive\\nFriend: Hahaha\\nPersona: What! Hahahahaha\\nPersona: Because of the 3,7?\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: It\u2019s veeeeey low\\nFriend: Less than half\\nPersona: I don't think it is as urgent for me. Perhaps your extreme fitness lifestyle is provoking it a little\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: Anyway it\u2019s nothing serious you can fix it by taking iron pills\\nFriend: And they will even it out\\nFriend: However in long term you need to stop the bleeding\\nFriend: Cause this is the root cause of the issue\\nPersona: 9,8 for me\\nPersona: but I\u2019ll treat it asap anyway, because of your horror stories\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: Good idea\\nFriend: Think about it\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: He never got a reply from Dan\\nFriend: Dan Hardt\\nFriend: Ohfuck\\nFriend: I mean Daniel\\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\\nPersona: I see\\nFriend: Yeah sorry\\nFriend: I confused the names\\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

What do u think about that?\\nFriend: ok wait, I'll review them\\nFriend: why not idea 3?\\nFriend: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nPersona: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nPersona: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nFriend: ok I am checking them rn\\nFriend: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nFriend: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nFriend: I had one chance and I took it\\nPersona: Don't stress it\\nFriend: i think i agree with you\\nFriend: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nFriend: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nFriend: I wrote in green\\nFriend: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nPersona: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nFriend: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nFriend: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nPersona: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha"

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?
