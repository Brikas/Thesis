What are you doing Sunday?\nPersona: Idk actually, should I invite some of closest friends over?\nPersona: I am not sure\nFriend: Hell yeah!\nWho do you have in mind?\nFriend: I have metal forms for flan\nPersona: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f missed your call.\nPersona: you at work?\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nPersona: interview went great, think the marketinf manager, cto and hr liked me\nPersona: but they said there is.another tevhnical intetview later\nPersona: they will.call me after they sum up\nFriend: Airi! \nIf you feel celebrating with others I can give a hand and help setup\nWh\nPersona: Before I had an idea to host a great party at juste place like always with many people, but I though its too much for this time, already feeling too busy, maybe next year a big great party again \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: on my birthday I love to hang out with you though maybe just chill time. Wish Patryk was here too\nPersona: not feeling like hanging out with anyone from CBS though\nPersona: if we stay at my dorm then I could also invite the the ukrainian dude with his wife\nPersona: Now I am thinking about cake xd\nPersona: I will buy some nice cake from Meny\nPersona: Ok now I am thinking about just a casual hang out in my kitchen \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Maybe would be pretty nice to invite Kuba, Lu, maybe Ivan. But I am not feeling like I want much attention\nPersona: I want a low key chill evening xd\nPersona: but maybe that would work\nFriend: St Patricks day today\nFriend: What you up to\nPersona: work\nPersona: then relax home after\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so there are some differences then that you found\nFriend: in this particular case it's not very telling because we didn't see any correlation with behaviour\nFriend: but read the first paragraph here\nPersona: like entrepreneurs show a higher dmpfc activation when it comes to getting rewards for oneself, while managers show higher activation when the rewards is not for them. If you had you translate this to a general business newspaper article headline, how would it sound?\nPersona: okay give me a sec\nFriend: this for example could indicate that higher activation is related to decision efficiency\nPersona: ok it kind of vaguely answers my question I think\nFriend: not really. it just indicates that ent and man may be affected differently by decision context\nFriend: but still so what if it doesn't have effect on behaviour\nPersona: Is dmpfc high/low somehow related to exploration/explotation?\nPersona: exploitation*\nPersona: Even if there are no behavioral differences. if the brain activations are different that might show something about the difference between man and ent. Especially if I could know what those activations mean generally. Like if higher dmpfc activation is also present when eating ice cream during winter, then that might tell me that entrepreneurs taking risk has something in common with eating ice cream during winter\nPersona: the example is stupid\nPersona: but\nPersona: I hope you get the pount\nFriend: not to my knowledge. we investigated that region bc it has been shown previously that it may be involved in differentiation between decisions made for self and others (see 1st paragraph below). that's actually a useful result of our study bc it adds evidence to that hypothesis\nFriend: in a perfect world yes, but in reality it is possible that this effect is due to chance. fMRI is not a terribly reliable or replicable method, so take that with a rain of salt\nFriend: nothing is really this straightforward in neuroscience, but thats a long conversation\nPersona: google is being really helpful\nFriend: valence is just positive or negative\nPersona: ok so basically, I can't really raise the findings of your thesis above the neuroscience sea level, and it mostly concerns other neuroscience research. It can't show something to someone not in neuroscience yet.\nPersona: would that be right?\nFriend: I think that's a good way to look at it. it's useful for the sake of perfecting the methodology (both in terms of what to do and what not to do), but we haven't really come any closer to understanding what differentiates entrepreneurs from the gen. population\nPersona: okay, fair enough\nPersona: ty for the patience haha\nFriend: not gonna lie, choosing the post nye hangover day for discussing science is quite cruel of you \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: but you're very welcome\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I biked 30 min home\nPersona: 2 hours before each rimworld game is modding\nPersona: And I love this modding community\nPersona: I am currently running ~100 mods\nPersona: and its lighly modded in a way\nPersona: most of the mods are quality of life\nPersona: 1 mod is a complete overhaul, maybe 10 - 15 major content mods\nPersona: and another 10 - 20 minor content mods\nPersona: rest quality of life\nPersona: I don't even know whats vanilla tbh\nPersona: I have to use an external Rimworld mod manager with python\nFriend: :DD\nPersona: Rimworld is so nice\nPersona: So additing\nPersona: I dont need life goals. I can have goals in rimworld and live with that\nPersona: I had a pretty good gamd yesterday. I been trying to play naked brutality with almost harderst difficulty, hardcire combat overhaul mod and perdeath\nPersona: I got pretty far, mode than usual. Usually, I survive around a year and my colony dies, but always in some different ways\nPersona: Hey mate, patryk, antoni and I are going to try cs2 today\nPersona: do you want to join?\nFriend: Yess\nFriend: Getting it now\nPersona: \ud83e\udd29\nFriend: a bit slow tho\nPersona: same\nPersona: I started 18o clock is still going\nPersona: its*\nPersona: how much left?\nFriend: 50\nPersona: wanna hop on dc?\nFriend: WomboCombo#4163\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: it's called perron\nPersona: hm. its not working. Try thinking in different pose\nFriend: will try\nPersona: okay, try that one, will you?\nPersona: I bet you will come up with th best ideas\nPersona: btw, great success today - made friends with two ITU people that will sign me up for Scroll bar\nPersona: I also had a great laugh from this italian data science professor, he kept using the adjective Ultra. Sometimes for him things very even ultra ultra something. Me and my friend my a bet whether he will say \"giga\" and then we also made a bet that if he said ultra ultra ultra (3 time), I would stand up and correct him, that in this case he should say giga.\nPersona: But none of that happen. We concluded that his best one was \"ultra stellar\"\nPersona: made*\nPersona: but I concluded I will probably not apply to ITU\nFriend: why\nPersona: I think one of the programmes at DTU will be better\nFriend: shit, sorry. I was a bit drunk yesterday, and apparently overconfident that I can multi-task during a pee break\nFriend: tbh that why took all the power of my remaining 1.5 brain cells and a headstand\nFriend: but what's the vibe of people there in general? I don't hear anything about that school ever, except that it exists\nFriend: hahah was he so hyped up about itu or about data science?\nFriend: I'm def stealing this one\nFriend: you know, I never really go open days bc I feel like it doesn't really represent the place accurately, i.e. everything seems 1000x better than in reality\nFriend: but I've always wondered whether I'm missing out or not\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: if I can do it (done it in the past successfully), then you should definetely be able to\nPersona: just pee longer\nPersona: Xdddd\nPersona: how much ethanol intoxitacion did you have? \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: although if you did a headstand... well, a short accidental headstand could very well be a symptom of high ethanol intoxication, so its possible I guess\nPersona: yeah, its quite rare to meet the ITU species. Vybe is nerdier, my best discovery was that they host occassional LAN parties (everybody brings they gaming rigs to school and play League, csgo, etc tournaments all night while drinking energy drinks)\nPersona: That I would like to participate abd I got conctacts\nPersona: but I think to find out the real vibe, an experiential visit to the scroll bar must be done. And we already made some connections there that will add us to the guest list this friday. So for that you will have to come with me and find out \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: I think the combination, he kept emphasizing (ultraemphasizing) that its so ultra ultra cool that the lecturers who teach each data science course are also active reaearchers in these topics\nPersona: I kinda took it for granted at CBS, but he was positioning it as a real USP (Unique selling point)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That's not necessarily the problem\nFriend: I wanna go\nFriend: Make the bbq\nFriend: What's the whole point in having a party\nFriend: Of you're gon a be late and not participate in doing the most important thing(which is the actual bbq)\nFriend: And I've been waiting for such a long time and no one came\nFriend: And I told them that it's my birthday\nFriend: So i need to hurry\nPersona: whhhhaa no one  came?\nFriend: I got the job!!\nFriend: They came to get me in the end\nPersona: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nPersona: OMG\nPersona: congratulatiom\nPersona: damn thats a doubl\u0119 party now\nFriend: Hehe\ud83d\ude0a\u2764\nFriend: Hope it's gonna go well\nFriend: The party I mean\nPersona: Hows your health today? xd\nPersona: good morning btw\nPersona: Yo wtf I still cant untie the shoe haha\nFriend: Morniing\nFriend: It's good...?\nFriend: What about u:))\nFriend: Told yaaa\nFriend: Dum dum\nPersona: Im fine, getting my hangover ass home\nPersona: its literally so tight haha\nPersona: I cant untie it. no jokes\nFriend: You didn't go home?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: pho\nPersona: maybe pho\nPersona: burger is nice too\nPersona: STEAK\nPersona: im in\nPersona: get some steaks on the way\nPersona: we cooking \ud83d\ude0d\nPersona: sounds good too\nPersona: okay\nFriend: Here\nFriend: I'm famous!\nFriend: Gonna see you tomorrow at SAP?\nPersona: wait a bit, I forgot, I tell you in a bit\nPersona: Petyo wants to have a little gathering for a birthday at my dorm in the cinema room\nPersona: and he only can tommorow\nPersona: So I gotta change plans\nPersona: do you want to join? Petyo is inviting you and your +1s too\nFriend: That sucks\nFriend: I can't as I got invited for this SAP thingy\nPersona: okay :(\nFriend: Patryk called you.\nPersona: Hmm\nPersona: Sounds good\nPersona: I am joining\nPersona: Should I buy a ticket now?\nPersona: Just give me the instructions what to do, chef \ud83e\udee1\nPersona: I have a film recomendation\nPersona: Very different from the last\nPersona: I haven't seen such a good one for a while. From technicalities, to the boldness and richness of the plot.\nPersona: Triangle of Sadness\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I think I'm gonna start crying honestly\nPersona: YOU GOT IT?\nFriend: Mo\nFriend: No\nFriend: I'm waiting to be interviewed\nPersona: Oh\nPersona: why the cry tho?\nFriend: I'm crying because I'm annoyed and stressed af\nFriend: I've been waiting for 15 minutes already\nPersona: ah dont be so\nPersona: you have the luck today\nPersona: and when you get\nFriend: The luck of being late at my own bday party,\nPersona: we will celebrate haha\nFriend: ?*\nFriend: ....\nFriend: Mhm yeah\nPersona: hey\nPersona: think you'll get it\nPersona: shit thoughts aside\nFriend: That's not necessarily the problem\nFriend: I wanna go\nFriend: Make the bbq\nFriend: What's the whole point in having a party\nFriend: Of you're gon a be late and not participate in doing the most important thing(which is the actual bbq)\nFriend: And I've been waiting for such a long time and no one came\nFriend: And I told them that it's my birthday\nFriend: So i need to hurry\nPersona: whhhhaa no one  came?\nFriend: I got the job!!\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\nFriend: i get this\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\nPersona: well almost applied\nPersona: I am confused. I have the legal right for Digital Business masters\nPersona: so what do I put in the personal statement field. Its required\nPersona: LOL shortest personal statement ever\nPersona: Whats your 2nd and 3rd prio?\nFriend: Do you need that\nFriend: No other prios\nPersona: straight to IS\nPersona: no othet option\nPersona: I like it\nPersona: sup my friend\nPersona: whar r u up to\nPersona: I woke up just now from a peaceful.sleel\nPersona: sleep*\nPersona: I cant cure the addiction to rimworld. I cant even search for it properly. The devs thought about it before hand by introducinh in-game addiction\nPersona: I have realized that I fall into the combined category of RimWorld, Minecraft and Factorio games\nPersona: gamers*\nPersona: cause many peoplr when talking about rimworld addiction refference mostky factorio\nPersona: and sometimes minecraft and oxygen not included\nFriend: yeah! Signed up for that through CBS\n\nare you going?\nFriend: was with Laura \nshe had bday\nPersona: I missed the good tickets\nPersona: so now its the 2hour ones lefy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What date is it ?\nPersona: saturday\nPersona: Come to our party\nPersona: its happening in an hour\nPersona: bring dana\nPersona: You called Denis.\nFriend: You missed a call from Denis.\nFriend: U have my adress ?\nFriend: I can join for few hours\nPersona: The video chat ended.\nPersona: send address\nFriend: Bispeparken 42\nPersona: here\nPersona: like last time\nPersona: You called Denis.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: You called Denis.\nPersona: u got in?\nFriend: Clozing\nFriend: What kitchen ?\nFriend: Can u open ?\nFriend: For us ?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: bri\nPersona: u good\nPersona: where r u?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: Hey man, how are you?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: The most stressfull part is when your best colonist is about to bleed out in 1 hour and you are hoping a medic can patch them up just in time\nPersona: or when somebody gets an infection and the immunity build up rate has to surpass the infection rate\nPersona: thats real stress\nPersona: but I don't think about that\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is not getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is now getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison (edited)\nFriend: sounds unreal\nwhen you describe things like that I imagine it's some Red dead redemption graphics kind of game\nFriend: but with even more freedom in choice what to do\nPersona: but you get this graphic\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\nFriend: i get this\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\nPersona: well almost applied\nPersona: I am confused.

Text below:\nConversations between persona and friends\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nPersona: yeah, I am trying to convince him that funneling pressurized air through straws will increase the GPU cooling effectiveness by 30%, resulting in faster model training speeds\nPersona: I think it makes total sense. Otherwise it would be strange\nPersona: Now you are too kind\nFriend: and that's without cheating? time to rethink career choices. your powers are getting wasted on the smart stuff\nFriend: apparently there's even a douchebag manual in case you need some extra guidance\nFriend: on top of that, this will stop him from talking for a moment. well played sir\nFriend: perhaps. they would be too powerful if they had people skills as well\nFriend: let's see if you'll still hold that view once the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate\nPersona: hey how are you? how do you feel with tommorows interview\nPersona: sorry had a terribly busy week and I am just terrible at chatting xd\nPersona: weirdly, but I learnt some/many of these things are if not neccesary then very effective at climbing the ladder\nPersona: Some are bad and ineffective, but I feel this guide can actually be effective ahaha\nPersona: like at work for example, you have to get noticed not only by your manager, but by manager's manager. You really have to make sure that your skill is noticed\nPersona: This guide really reminds me of Lithuanian older generation\nPersona: Also after reading this guide I realized I also had a wrong understanding of 'arrogant'\nPersona: With your help I will redefine my whole vocab\nPersona: I think this evening I had the most social experience in our anti-social kitchen\nPersona: 4 of us were holding an inclusive conversation for a considerable time\nPersona: Good luck today!\nPersona: How did it go?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: environment hostility wise, woundnt all other planets suck?\nPersona: or Venus is somehow extra naughty?\nPersona: okay you are right, I would not be drinking then. I could be sipping non alcoholic pina colada or cola maybe\nPersona: so you only talk to me as a manager? \ud83d\ude22 Should I start looking for a luxury rooftop hot tub and start crying about my loneliness already?\nPersona: Sometimes I forget you are polish\nPersona: you seem to cocealing your inner polish quite well\nPersona: to be*\nPersona: I tried this btw. I think it might be working\nFriend: full 3 min version? because this is gold, you're missing out otherwise \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: oof, no, this is tricky socially. I don't know if there's a way out of this other than somewhat concerned 'oh okay'\nFriend: or deflect with a question\nFriend: I mean, as much as neurodivergence is celebrated these days, I'm sure every parents wants nothing more than for their kid to be healthy and have a life as easy as possible which is not exactly the case here\nFriend: it is. it's referred to as hell planet for a reason. that's not the right vibe\nFriend: milk! like a psychopath\nFriend: yeah no, you just don't know me very well haha\nFriend: I'm proud :')\nFriend: oh look. now you can cry whenever and wherever you want!\nPersona: Shampoo, bathtub and a sponge. Thats a whole depression cure kit \ud83d\ude31\nFriend: but no Pitbull :/\nPersona: How flat do you need to be on the ground for your famous depression repelling ritual, and is pivko neccessary?\nPersona: I am afraid lack of Pitbull might not be the only issue here\nPersona: I think so, I will see again\nPersona: ok I didnt before xddd\nPersona: but now I did xd\nPersona: I cant believe this is real autism. It cant be that bad come on\nPersona: With some spacer level advanced life support a hell environment would be THE vibe. You there crying in your nanotech-anti-gravity-force-field suit, while an apocalypse is raging outside. A perfect contrast, or perhaps a perfect reflection\nPersona: I need to do this sometime as a social experiment\nPersona: during a night out, pull out some a milk bottle, pour it in the glass, drink it and say no word\nPersona: (without polish hazelnut vodka)\nPersona: I must meet a polish Joanna\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: data couch on character ai?\nFriend: Date\nFriend: Ella\nPersona: ohhh\nPersona: I misread data\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: Kota - daylight\nFriend: Listen to 0:40 to 0:45\nPersona: :DDDDD\nPersona: Why would one ask this even in the altenative meaning? \"I wonder if my dad hangs out with me?\"\nPersona: Or it means \"get along with?\"\nPersona: still you don't need to wonder, you know that :D\nFriend: yeah get along with more\nnot hang out with\nFriend: getting along is a good alternative for fuck with\nFriend: get along good\nPersona: Alright\nPersona: I would not use it with someone unless they know the meaning of it\nFriend: but i think it's not easy to know sometimes \n\nlike we hang out less time f.ex. but at some point maybe you think I start being too much gme conspiracy and not interesting for you to be friends with\n\nbut you would'nt say it outright so we just meet less and less and you avoid going out f.ex. with me\n\nbut because it hasnt been said out loud I can't know if there is something wrong and if you get along with me still\nFriend: yeah :D\nPersona: hm, in that hypothetical situation yeah, I agree question makes sense\nFriend: bruuh\nbe happy your boss is not writing you\nFriend: mine started writing me\nFriend: and he is super micro managing\nFriend: I found out there is even a coined term for it from the colleagues\n\nthe famous \"non confrontational discussion\"\nFriend: 1 hour we argue when do i work\nPersona: damn\nPersona: Xdd\nPersona: it happened to me too\nPersona: For two yeara I am recording each minute of my work on google sheets\nPersona: for each task\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\nPersona: nice article\nPersona: it looks so good\nPersona: character ai can't write code, it sucks at it.

what's even the alternative? that they could be a full time teacher or that they would work in the industry?\nPersona: JUST two wine glasses you say...\nPersona: well... Small BAC level is intuitively proven to increase non formal social performance\nPersona: So you are approching mainstream methods\nPersona: excuse me! LAN parties are great, they are a rarity. They also have DnD games at ITU\nPersona: our course meterial at CBS includes only dictonaries of acronyms that we have to learn. Thats all there is to it in a business bachelors\nPersona: I actually had an englighment about my interpretation of CBS as a university recently.\nPersona: I dont know too\nPersona: if you manage to see this text in the upcoming few hours, do you want to go to ITU scroll bar tonight?\nPersona: do you want to go to the craziest party in the craziest copenhagen kollegium tonight?\nFriend: hey, sorry. I was offline all weekend and probably will be missing for some time longer. I need to think\nPersona: what happened?\nPersona: Whats the thinking your doing? give me a TLDR\nPersona: Do you want to chat offline if you are going to be offline for a while? \ud83d\ude04\nFriend: frankly, not really - I don't really want to talk to anyone atm, but I realize that I do owe you that sometime soon\nPersona: Do you play games? there is one really interesting game that I keep coming back to that I think you would like. It's a simulation game with huge depth, including deep personalities of people, relationships, mental states. And its all set in a distant planet, where technologies range from tribal to advanced \"glitterworld\" mechanoid tech. Its called Rimworld\nPersona: If you are taking some time not talking to anyone I think you should try it\nPersona: because it's a singleplayer game (there is mod for multiplayer for those who insist)\nPersona: Would love to give you an intro to that game too or hear your stories playing it (the game calls itself story generator)\nFriend: oh wow nice timing. I literally thought 2 seconds ago that I should write to you to say sorry, because I'm being an asshole for no reason\nFriend: I can't talk rn, but will look at the rest in the evening\nPersona: all good\nPersona: and yeah look at that game in the evening if you have time\nFriend: my gamer girl career started and ended at sims 1 circa 2005\nFriend: so I understand nothing\nFriend: but it does seem that people reaaally love it\nPersona: no way ahahaha\nPersona: thats almost hard to believe. You havent played anything since?\nFriend: I probably played a bit of something online when I was a kid\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\nPersona: thats a CV\nPersona: You are hired!\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: need to re-read when im out of class somewhere quiet\nPersona: I think for the next one, if you want to write smth useful, you can share an insight or idea that you heard and was really interesting. Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\nPersona: WTF\nPersona: mac is cool\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster. Not even exxagerating\nFriend: Oh yeah\n\nWhen Stan showed me, it was magic\nFriend: But i think you can do that on windows too\n\nWith more setup tho\nPersona: Havent read fully but could be interesting\nPersona: If you want to improve decision making speed or suffer from decision paralysis (which I do)\nFriend: looks like a good read\nFriend: I'll check it out\nFriend: I swear my \"almost\" accidents with the bike are mostly women or colored foreigners\nFriend: once an oldie\nFriend: today a woman decided the bike lane means extra points x___x\nFriend: she got scared when I decided to cross\nPersona: Xddd\nPersona: what do you mean? She was with car?\nPersona: Its a consensus that women are worse drivers. But also its pretty known that women get into accidents lets afaik\nPersona: less*\nPersona: If you take pen testing, women have a offensive advantage\nFriend: what\nPersona: xddd idk why this 'what' soundes funny\nPersona: i will explain later\nFriend: Aaah!\nFriend: Like the lady bond villains\nFriend: I got nais balls\nFriend: Really big pack\nPersona: XDDDDDDD"

I'm just teasing you\nFriend: had no idea, but yup, sounds about American\nFriend: you can look at this from 2 perspectives: 1) I'm working on a therapy aimed to help people suffering from severe cases of dead social battery; 2) currently I'm protecting people from the grumpiness induced by my own severe case of dead social battery\nFriend: thank you. that was a perfect field report\nFriend: I accept it as the official version of historical events and refuse to listen to or read anything else about it\nFriend: oh wow. that's really a lot of people\nFriend: aw they're so cute with their little flags\nPersona: its perfect for americans, think about it - you can fit a family of 5 highly overweight persons and at the same time mount a 50cal in the back in case of property defence situation or just for fun.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different.

The display and placement?\nFriend: that's a vaild point, in europe we are so free that we don't care about consequences of our deeds xdd\nFriend: Minimalism, no advertisments, just pure extension of my brain which can improve my productivity without getting me into some mindless scrolling of instagram or fb. And the rapid way you can access the knowledge also sounds like a huge pros\nFriend: beside that if my friends would use it I wouldnt have so much comfort as it feels like you are interrogated xdd\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so there are some differences then that you found\nFriend: in this particular case it's not very telling because we didn't see any correlation with behaviour\nFriend: but read the first paragraph here\nPersona: like entrepreneurs show a higher dmpfc activation when it comes to getting rewards for oneself, while managers show higher activation when the rewards is not for them. If you had you translate this to a general business newspaper article headline, how would it sound?\nPersona: okay give me a sec\nFriend: this for example could indicate that higher activation is related to decision efficiency\nPersona: ok it kind of vaguely answers my question I think\nFriend: not really. it just indicates that ent and man may be affected differently by decision context\nFriend: but still so what if it doesn't have effect on behaviour\nPersona: Is dmpfc high/low somehow related to exploration/explotation?\nPersona: exploitation*\nPersona: Even if there are no behavioral differences. if the brain activations are different that might show something about the difference between man and ent. Especially if I could know what those activations mean generally. Like if higher dmpfc activation is also present when eating ice cream during winter, then that might tell me that entrepreneurs taking risk has something in common with eating ice cream during winter\nPersona: the example is stupid\nPersona: but\nPersona: I hope you get the pount\nFriend: not to my knowledge. we investigated that region bc it has been shown previously that it may be involved in differentiation between decisions made for self and others (see 1st paragraph below). that's actually a useful result of our study bc it adds evidence to that hypothesis\nFriend: in a perfect world yes, but in reality it is possible that this effect is due to chance. fMRI is not a terribly reliable or replicable method, so take that with a rain of salt\nFriend: nothing is really this straightforward in neuroscience, but thats a long conversation\nPersona: google is being really helpful\nFriend: valence is just positive or negative\nPersona: ok so basically, I can't really raise the findings of your thesis above the neuroscience sea level, and it mostly concerns other neuroscience research. It can't show something to someone not in neuroscience yet.\nPersona: would that be right?\nFriend: I think that's a good way to look at it. it's useful for the sake of perfecting the methodology (both in terms of what to do and what not to do), but we haven't really come any closer to understanding what differentiates entrepreneurs from the gen. population\nPersona: okay, fair enough\nPersona: ty for the patience haha\nFriend: not gonna lie, choosing the post nye hangover day for discussing science is quite cruel of you \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: but you're very welcome\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: will ask, or you can in the group\nFriend: I saw we talked in group but no one said what they have or need\nSo ill dm them\nPersona: okay thx\nPersona: fucking hell bro, this group assignment is in deep trouble, my peers just really rushed it, somethings of what they wrote make minimal sense or add no value whatsoever. They are there just to include a reference to satisfy teachers, but it will just make them mad\nPersona: She studies MSc information systems in CBS and we met cause I asked if she could share her xp with that course\nPersona: That was only one opinion, but it seemed like this course at CBS not what I want because its too non-technical, the actual coding you do is same as BSc level we did at Digital Managment. Its mostly management stuff, but she hardly applied it at her work as a scrum master in Orsted, where she manages IT system dev.\nPersona: I can tell you more about it if you are contemplating this program, but today I almost fully decided that I am not taking MSc IS\nPersona: But we talked a bunch about ITU and ITU actually seems like a place. At ITU they really do and learn shit. She said what we learned in whole year for programming at CBS, that was like 1mo at ITU. She said at ITU you have no life.\nPersona: Which I like, because what we learn at CBS is ehhh, you can be very lazy and still pass. Its about the connections and the brand where CBS is nice.\nPersona: I think I will look more into Software Architect, that actually might be a good place to be for me. But that's not at CBS prob.\nFriend: sounds like i wanna go there\nFriend: interesting\nPersona: then its nice, keep getting that econ requirement solved\nPersona: why?\nFriend: Thought you wanted the prestige more\nPersona: yeah I want prestige, but I also want right content\nFriend: Man.. I wish I has a healthy view like that on studies\nFriend: You sent me podcast screenshot\nWas it here? Doesn't show in media and files\nWhat was name of episodes\nPersona: yeah it was here\nPersona: check media\nPersona: whats your view and whats unhealthy about it?\nFriend: Found it ty\nFriend: I want skills but feel like i shouldn't go for it\nBecause i was not good at bigger picture. Relations etc. Need to go for that \nMaybe it's not unhealthy but it goes against what i want and am comfortable with. Want to stay in my bubble\nPersona: What do you mean by skills? coding and hands-on stuff?\nPersona: And by relations, big picture you mean management, right?\nFriend: Yeah. Hard skills \n\nAlso i lack management knowledge but it requires a lot more soft skills too\nFriend: I can go to Silvan today and pick up what you chose if you like?\nAnd get.for myself\nFriend: Or would you prefer friday and go together\nPersona: It would be hard to transport stuff in bike \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Nah\nBackpacks\nCan totally do it\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: lol\nPersona: thats overthinking at its finest\nFriend: Cause maybe i am and colleagues pitty me and give me a win for the competition\nFriend: I did the math. Its more likely\nPersona: this is a reddit post. \n\nI though I am retarded because I guessed a 1/400 random number\nPersona: oh\nPersona: in that way\nPersona: but why out of pity?\nFriend: Wanna bike the holiday?\nIm taking the dino for a ride maybe\nFriend: Cause im retarded\nFriend: M3 line has a QR code hunt\nAnd then you get free choco bunny and a chance to win some museum tickets\nPersona: wait I am in shower xd\nPersona: okay, but i dont think you are retarded\nPersona: at most you are a little bit childish, but I dont think colleagues would mind that\nPersona: I am in portugal man\nPersona: or what day you are talking about?\nFriend: You're where :o\nFriend: Good to hear xD cause that gif is how ive been feeling today\nFriend: Friday saturday sunday monday \nWhatever\nFriend: They have it to monday including\nPersona: yeah bro, I am on a cbs surf trip \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I am back on Monday\nFriend: Holy moly nice\nAnd short sleeve? Good weather \ud83d\ude01\nFriend: Enjoy! I'll see you when you're back then\nFriend: That sand loooks goood\nFriend: Wanna step bare feet\nLooks soft\nPersona: yeah today is good\nPersona: sometimes a bit windy\nPersona: 17-23 at the hot time of day\nFriend: did you see this\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: chest\nPersona: could be\nPersona: I think it could be sweat\nPersona: I heard this before\nPersona: sweat is attractive\nPersona: I also kinda like women sweat lol\nPersona: oh dear\nPersona: nice, is it now?\nFriend: yeah i think so\nPersona: nice\nPersona: maybe next weeknd we could take some nice photos\nFriend: yee\nnext weekend Zoe bday tho\nPersona: lets see as the time goes\nFriend: you wanna do during week or no?\nPersona: I need to give back sword and shield to zoe\nPersona: idk if I am capable\nPersona: I need extra hours in a day\nFriend: yeah..\nFriend: day kinda short\nbut so nice weather\nFriend: gotta go chill on the beaches\nPersona: weather niceee\nPersona: but this weekend I have startuo weekend\nPersona: its like hackathon for startups\nFriend: nice tho\ngj being productive\nPersona: yeah its easy when you sign up for stuff\nPersona: you force yourself\nPersona: but my team is barely satisfactory. I kimda fucked up with team choice\nPersona: But its interesting in terms of team competencies\nPersona: 2 technical ppl. 2 cbs business people\nPersona: and me\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: But the pace is still faster than Squad or Arma3. Much faster\nPersona: I would say I really recomend it\nFriend: Sounds good\nPersona: I woouln't*\nPersona: I dont recomend it very mcuh xd or maybe thats my impression after trying the new version\nPersona: it almost feels the same as the old, but for someone who never played, Insurgency might be intereating\nPersona: and terryfying\nPersona: like this game is so scary, you are advancing and someone lays down some suppressive fire on you. It.feels intense\nFriend: imagine that in vr :o\nPersona: would be cool\nPersona: last minute decided to go\nFriend: Have fun \ud83d\ude18\nFriend: I'm planing to go for bouldering\nFriend: With Antoni\nPersona: okey, you have fun too\nPersona: networking after gaming was a bad idea\nFriend: Why? Xdd\nPersona: nvm\nPersona: I got into it xd\nFriend: as it hard to start networking?\nPersona: yeah until I talked to the first person\nPersona: then I became a conversation beast \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: how was bouldering, sorry coundnt come had this spontanplan\nPersona: What about bouldering another day? When do you go next? Also bobby wanted to join us\nPersona: Happy boi \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: No worries\nFriend: We can go in the weekend or from next week \ud83d\udc4c\nFriend: Who is Bobby? Xd\nPersona: Borislav\nPersona: Bulgarian guy from Winterbadning\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I finish work 17:30\nPersona: then I am free\nFriend: Sunday\nFriend: Im stupid\nFriend: Not today\nPersona: y not?\nFriend: I go at Lauras now\nWe will nolife\nFriend: But movies are half price sunday\nFriend: Its some special day at that cinema\nPersona: play games?\nFriend: Yeah\nFriend: Candidates are\nMinecraft\n stardew valley\nFriend: Somethimg where we can build together i want\nPersona: ice bathing tmmrow 13:30\nPersona: Fuuuucking nice\nPersona: play a modpack\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\nPersona: big jealous\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\nPersona: sunday is raining\nPersona: What about the cinema?\nPersona: are we going?\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\nPersona: We booked it\nPersona: book fast bro\nPersona: bump\nFriend: Ok will do\nFriend: Yeah! What times you up for? Ill look at projections in a minute\nFriend: Think there are 11 14\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: in*\nPersona: Do you want to also volunteer in Presidents Summit?\nPersona: Yo for friday, I will only free up around 22 tho\nFriend: Whats that\nSend me\nFriend: Oh for going out or what was friday\nPersona: yup\nPersona: but actually after the meeting, I got to know they just started accepting applications this week and they need 100total, they will be reaching out to KU and CBS, so I dont think its hard to be accepted\nFriend: Was at one campus in KU yesterday\nFriend: they had some open day introducing bachelors there\nFriend: I talked with a bunch of people\nwas so ez being social about it\nPersona: nice\nPersona: will save me time not having to yandex \"scihub proxy\" xdd\nPersona: you think cause its KU?\nFriend: I think because of the social setting\n\nThey were they having their tables ready to present the bachelor to people that want to study it\nPersona: ah yeah it was the people behinx counters\nPersona: but generally at bar I found KU ppl easier going\nFriend: And I have some extra social power sometimes so I made them get excited\n\nAsk about their fav subject and then get in depth and discuss some social aspects f ex\nFriend: Maybe its cause KU ppl are chill\nFriend: One dude was slack lining between the trees outside\nPersona: lol, at CBS that would be rare\nFriend: Ye.. talked with 2 guys from cbs and one quit\nSaid he doesntike the whole slick back hair and attitude\nFriend: We gotta chill at KU more\nFriend: Lottsa girls in health and geology and other subjects\nPersona: Ku and I want to try ITU too\nPersona: in 10 years I think I will write a secret book. \"The reverse relationship between mathematical/coding abilities and attractiveness in women\"\nFriend: Yeah!\nFriend: Think it's a relevant book for the time written\nBecause social dynamics define that a lot\nPersona: I now have a little hypothesis that given attractiveness is not only about physical appearance, logical stupidity makes women more attractive\nPersona: but thats illegal stuff\nPersona: and thats also kinda a joke xd\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I judge courses too much by the crowd\nPersona: like ITU really turned me off for some reason, althought I talked to very few. I visually judged lol. Thats bad\nPersona: this is CBS people\nPersona: fucking gorgeous, but evolutionary unfit\nFriend: ah yeah. maybe \na little more than 6 I think\n\ncause I didn't have full su first education\nFriend: I affirm\nFriend: but .. idk\n\nthere is a lot of that in life too\nPersona: of what?\nPersona: visual judging?\nPersona: or juding by crowd?\nFriend: both\n\nthink it's efficient to stick around ppl with looks\nFriend: just like in stock market because you assume market is efficient and someone else did the math, best to invest in whats going up\nFriend: xd idk that didnt make sense\nPersona: It made sense after I read it twice\nPersona: but it may not be because somebody did the math\nPersona: price went up. Somebody thought somebody did the math\nPersona: but nobody did the math\nFriend: exactly\nPersona: but so many people baught that the buying changed the math itself, so now the math is suddently good anyways\nPersona: time to write that personal statement. Fuck I hope I can go to sleep soon\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago"

I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I don't even need to know how to write google apps script, python is enough\nPersona: Okay, he wrote shit code\nPersona: but he did well on this enslavery attempt\nPersona: Man, I managed to hook up live data from my Lithuanian bank to a spreadsheet\nPersona: Feels so good to pull such highly protected data like from the banks to a spreadsheet automatically\nPersona: And I can conenct other banks, like revolut, my danish AL bank. Hopefully the add Lunar\nPersona: But the hard part now (prob for later) is to program this to integrate with my finance mastersheet. I need poll the transaction list every hour, check if there are any new entries compared to the previous poll. Then I gotta check if those entries don't already exist in my sheet (if was added manually), then I need to add those entried to the sheet.\nPersona: Ah I would also need to differentiate which transactions are regarded as transfers between my accounts (not spending or income), cause thats how I setup my system\nPersona: it may be too much time to make this work\nPersona: but I can get balance checks integrated pretty easy i think\nFriend: This risky stuff\nFriend: You making crazy stuff\nNice to see you got a connection wtd\nFriend: Didnt know its possible\nPersona: Yeah, but I think its only read access, atleast thats what I authorized for, so no risk for me\nFriend: ah nice when you can limit\nPersona: I would of course have to keep in secret key in the sheet, but the sheet is not shared\nPersona: Its not that hard actually, its as easy as simple API with one extra step, that you gotta authorize your bank\nPersona: I had to login into my swedbank and allow read access for Nordigen\nFriend: practicing my vid editing skills\nFriend: made a short one if you can review it\nFriend: but I couldn't share in fb.. lowest size i can get it to is 27mb\nFriend: but made for phone so if you can open there and see the feel\nPersona: alright, can you share in g drive?\nPersona: I will dl and open in phone\nPersona: I like the last part, has a bit more tempo\nPersona: First part is a bit too lenghty, I was unsure what to.look for and what to find intesresting\nPersona: I would do more cuts in the first part, or in another way make it shorter. You can also do some temporary short speedups with the rhythm\nPersona: Also, I dont think there is much value in keeping the title for so long\nPersona: show it for 0.5s before video and the song name maybe at the end of the video a little bit\nFriend: cause i took video in landscape\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I don't like page based, because a big task in note-taking is deciding where to put what and then deciding where to look for what. If you also need to think about pages, then its an extra variable in your decision making process.\nPersona: Logseq automates that, so any single block can be a page, you just press on it to zoom in and it becomes the root element\nPersona: But they also have pages (which is sometimes till needed so files don't get too large and if you want to collaborate, so you can work in diff files, like in coding)\nPersona: The only issue with Logseq is that its less stable and feels a little weirder and less polished than Obsidian. Obsidian is super smooth\nPersona: Next semester I will try switching uni notes to Logseq, but I am a little anxious. There will be many improvements with that - like I can't wait till I can use block embeds, also I will be able to share my notes with other people in a standardized format. Search functionality is better too.\nPersona: But I am anxious that the mindmap layout presentation will turn out to be much more superior to bullet list presentation when it comes to complex topics I will study. Also in Logseq there is less options for content visual customization, so making things standout is more limited (bolding, colors still work).\nPersona: bruuug sweet\nPersona: you look good\nFriend: Thanks man\nWas a good time\nFriend: I'm happy she wants to show me\nFriend: Was thinking some days before that ppl post on diff social media diff side of them and was wondering if she will just want her own photos on instagram\nFriend: Or would she show me\nFriend: Cause ive heard a lot instagram is more for dating kind of\nFriend: What are block embeds\nFriend: Yeah.. i want some way to combine mindmanager mindmaps with note app\nPersona: ig is general purpose social media\nPersona: i dont think it has much specialization like linkedin which is for professionals\nPersona: almost everykind of businness has ig profile these days\nPersona: I think instsgram is good for dating, but its the same as saying 'a car is good for dating'. Ita good but its not made for it specifically\nPersona: You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. \n\nobj_A = Object()\n\nobj_A.var1 = \"hello\"\nobj_A2 = obj_A\nobj_A2.var1 = \"world\"\nprint(obj_A.var1) // \"world\"\nPersona: thats prob best way to explain it\nPersona: its like a mirror reference thats editable\nPersona: mindmanager is so bad for integrations\nFriend: They have that?\n\nWhere does the real obj live\nIs one original and other are references\nFriend: Huh\nYoutube-like?\nFriend: But with photos\nPersona: I will show you later\nPersona: bro do you really have no idea how instragram is used?\nPersona: Its not like youtube in many ways. Its just very general. Less general than facebook, but fb has just became too general for the new times\nPersona: you post updates about what you do, about your interests, show off some aesthetic you capture, show off the imagine of yourself you are creating, show your hobbies maybe, show your personality in reel, photos, stories\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Apprently you can create a git repository in a Google Drive folder\nPersona: But\nPersona: since I like to learn stuff, I will find a workaround\nPersona: I will do the script later, I got a little bit annoyed while bulding it\nPersona: For now I will manually move items to it from time to time\nFriend: Ill be at DS 12 w/ u\nPersona: alright\nPersona: wya?\nPersona: oh fuck\nPersona: I am.in wronf one\nFriend: 2.08 In 1 sec\nPersona: btw in case you missed it, I shared the cases with you on a G drive invite\nPersona: The first case is super cool tho\nFriend: I saw thx\nFriend: Just finished it. It sure sounds like an interesting org 2 work in!\nFriend: I\u2019ll sit by the left side\nFriend: Plz bring a charger\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nPersona: Hey, I have been looking (a abit today, felt a bit bad) into the market research methods, also specifically into few, but will look more into it. I think focus groups is a solid choice but I already found some alternatives, and maybe there can be more.\nPersona: Its still WIP, but see some of the methodologies I mapped in my notes (linked to the For Elias) part\nPersona: I pushed to repo\nPersona: Hey, I'll skip the class today, cause I am a little sick\nFriend: I'll check it out. I've been thinking a lot about how we will present a certain product 2 the digital personas, and I feel like it's going to be challenging 2 not embed bias. Do u have any idea about that?\nFriend: Why is it it's called WIP?\nFriend: I'll share my notes. Hope u feel better soon!<3\nFriend: git config --global alias.cp '!git add . && git commit -m \"Quick update\" && git push'\nFriend: git config --global alias.up 'pull origin main'\nFriend: Here is 2 alias scripts. Put them into your terminal. So u from now on only need 2 \"cd\" into your local version of the repo, and then write \"git cp\" to share yours, and \"git up\" to get mine;)\nPersona: well, a persona must be biast by definition I would assume\nPersona: if you are 0 biast, then you are just a general person, not really a persona\nPersona: Or what kind of bias did you mean?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: The most stressfull part is when your best colonist is about to bleed out in 1 hour and you are hoping a medic can patch them up just in time\nPersona: or when somebody gets an infection and the immunity build up rate has to surpass the infection rate\nPersona: thats real stress\nPersona: but I don't think about that\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is not getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is now getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison (edited)\nFriend: sounds unreal\nwhen you describe things like that I imagine it's some Red dead redemption graphics kind of game\nFriend: but with even more freedom in choice what to do\nPersona: but you get this graphic\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\nFriend: i get this\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\nPersona: well almost applied\nPersona: I am confused. I have the legal right for Digital Business masters\nPersona: so what do I put in the personal statement field. Its required\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: although could just manually place , and decapitalize W\nPersona: bruh my work is taking over my mind. I can't focus on studying, I just keep thinking about work\nPersona: as if I am addicted to it.\nFriend: That is beautiful\n\nI loved my work at one point\nAnd my sidehustle\n\nEverything else was second\nFriend: I like that\nGood drive\n\nMaybe bad for relationship or others but i miss the feeling\nFriend: But hard if you think you want a good grade at studies\nPersona: bro, I spam you with so much random stuff and you still read it seriously\nPersona: I thank you for that <3\nPersona: Its the Lunar founder pitching lunar before it got popular\nPersona: dude Silicon Valley tv series is so good\nPersona: the italian is in germany for some wedding or smth, I am watching it alone and not telling it\nPersona: cause its so on point\nPersona: I am so immersed, so many moments are so good\nPersona: and when she comes back I will lovely watch it again pretending I didn't know, its just so good\nPersona: my highschool classmate\nPersona: how would you rate her out of 10?\nFriend: O nice to see the start\nFriend: It's insightful to see those services having to work with traditional finance to make it work\nFriend: I wonder how you make connection with traditional banks and convince them to make use of them in that way\nFriend: Because he did say they are eating their products\nFriend: No\nLooks like Corinne\nFriend: 7+ but really not my style so personally under 5\nPersona: ohh she so diff from corine in my mind. Also I guess the fact that I know her influences my perception\nFriend: Eastern European Corinne\nFriend: What is she working with\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: idk tbh\nPersona: she was just always hot for me\nPersona: What I call 'stupid hot bitches at CBS pretending to be smart'. I am probably relative the same to this guy\nPersona: whats ur thesis subj?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: ok so basically, I can't really raise the findings of your thesis above the neuroscience sea level, and it mostly concerns other neuroscience research. It can't show something to someone not in neuroscience yet.\nPersona: would that be right?\nFriend: I think that's a good way to look at it. it's useful for the sake of perfecting the methodology (both in terms of what to do and what not to do), but we haven't really come any closer to understanding what differentiates entrepreneurs from the gen. population\nPersona: okay, fair enough\nPersona: ty for the patience haha\nFriend: not gonna lie, choosing the post nye hangover day for discussing science is quite cruel of you \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: but you're very welcome\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\nFriend: we were just having drinks and playing board games until 6 in the morning\nFriend: how was yours?\nPersona: the fireworks weren't that good here haha, I was also home\nPersona: I had literallly the most chill too\nPersona: I felt a bit sick so stayed home, talked with friends on discord\nPersona: So I am alive and healthy today, apart from having an inverse daynight cycle for the past wekk\nFriend: oh god, I'm so sick of those. it felt like going through a war zone when I was biking to the dorm from home\nFriend: aw shame I didn't know. you could've joined us\nFriend: glad it's nothing serious. you're coming back to school already or you're having a longer Christmas break?\nPersona: isn't the bass you feel in your chest after an explosion kind of thrilling to you?\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I can recall those a bit\nPersona: but havent seen one being used for a while\nPersona: So apart from me, you, toby, who else was in? :D\nPersona: Do we need more time to prepare?\nFriend: drop by Lidl for snacks\n\nill go shower and maybe I come 5? Or too late\nFriend: Luiza says she is up for it\nMadalina sick\nidk if Zoe will show up\nFriend: Ivan\nFriend: thats it I think\nPersona: Patryk is working, right?\nPersona: lets meet at five then\nPersona: And go get snacks\nFriend: ye Patryk working\nPersona: Alright, I am mostly anxious if the cinema will work, but it should work\nPersona: If you would like strangers, I can imvite the ukrainian guy from my floor\nFriend: im fine with it\nPersona: alright, I'll hit him up, not sure if he is free tho\nPersona: this chilling at a couch thing is becoming a disease\nPersona: this weekend I mostly did that xd\nPersona: and a bit of Fluttter, so I am not completely pathetic\nFriend: xD\nFriend: what things have you learned when video editing btw?\nFriend: color correction\nmotion tracking\nsome fun examples?\nPersona: yeah all of those\nPersona: examples hm\nPersona: I can look up what I have a bit later, but the most fun I had is with After Effects technologies and also I enjoyed building consistent rhythm with thouhht out transitions and cuts\nPersona: A lot of magic happens when you film stuff with editing posibilities in mind\nPersona: motion graphics are also fun\nFriend: as in think what you wnt before you start filming?\nPersona: Yeah, one example would be getting some specific motion that you can take advantage of for transitions\nPersona: Also being inventive with filming, angles\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Lol nice\nFriend: Always slipping\n\nIts like ice skating shoes but for asphalt\nPersona: Xddd\nPersona: The artsyles prompt ideas are pretty cool though. And combining them is nice\nPersona: Good for making steam, forum avatars\nPersona: What do you use for notetaking?\nFriend: Notion is the shit imo\nFriend: Used it during internship\nFriend: Have a journal there\nFriend: And anything that has a time i try to immediately put in the calendar so i can keep track of life\nPersona: I been experimenting with notion for a while and idk, it does not stick to me\nPersona: Whole day I was researching note taking apps\nPersona: I feel it takes very long to make notes in Notion and having everything on many pages, things get lost and navigation takes time.\nPersona: Also I like the toggleable bullet list approach that MindManager for example uses\nPersona: Its hard for me to write in paragraph style\nPersona: I am experimenting with Obsidian and Logseq\nPersona: Obsidian is super cool, but its paragraph style\nPersona: Loqseq is bullet point style\nPersona: I watched note-taking, seconds brain apps for whole video and there was no mention of Mindmanager\nPersona: I might be too uses to it now, its really hard to switch. I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: nice\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\nPersona: yo wtf\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\nPersona: click the three dots\nPersona: and there is install app button\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website"

I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nPersona: yeah, I am trying to convince him that funneling pressurized air through straws will increase the GPU cooling effectiveness by 30%, resulting in faster model training speeds\nPersona: I think it makes total sense. Otherwise it would be strange\nPersona: Now you are too kind\nFriend: and that's without cheating? time to rethink career choices. your powers are getting wasted on the smart stuff\nFriend: apparently there's even a douchebag manual in case you need some extra guidance\nFriend: on top of that, this will stop him from talking for a moment. well played sir\nFriend: perhaps. they would be too powerful if they had people skills as well\nFriend: let's see if you'll still hold that view once the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate\nPersona: hey how are you? how do you feel with tommorows interview\nPersona: sorry had a terribly busy week and I am just terrible at chatting xd\nPersona: weirdly, but I learnt some/many of these things are if not neccesary then very effective at climbing the ladder\nPersona: Some are bad and ineffective, but I feel this guide can actually be effective ahaha\nPersona: like at work for example, you have to get noticed not only by your manager, but by manager's manager. You really have to make sure that your skill is noticed\nPersona: This guide really reminds me of Lithuanian older generation\nPersona: Also after reading this guide I realized I also had a wrong understanding of 'arrogant'\nPersona: With your help I will redefine my whole vocab\nPersona: I think this evening I had the most social experience in our anti-social kitchen\nPersona: 4 of us were holding an inclusive conversation for a considerable time\nPersona: Good luck today!\nPersona: How did it go?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Not feeling too good about this meeting in terms of what to suggest we reseach and how\nPersona: Maybe you can look how to pivot off this paper\nPersona: I havent really done that\nPersona: ughh why 8am ughh\nPersona: are you up.mate?\nFriend: I got an idea 2 how we could approach this\nFriend: I think we should have it open, 2 let him add his competences\nFriend: Long ago\nPersona: alright, do you want to call the 3 minds before call with him ahah?\nPersona: mins*\nFriend: Let's just raw dog it;)\nFriend: Get in\nFriend: Join the 1st link\nFriend: u send me\nFriend: Elias Salvador called you.\nPersona: I think Carsten is going to be quite good on idea 1\nFriend: Im back. Wanna Call now, or wait till 16?\nPersona: lets call in 5 mins\nFriend: Checking this in the meanwhile\nPersona: maybe its so on point actually, one of the 2 of the 3 strategies they concludeI think are somewhat related\nPersona: wait extra few minds, trying to set tu camera on my dekstop pc\nPersona: The video chat ended.\nPersona: The video chat ended.\nPersona: what happened\nPersona: The video chat ended.\nFriend: My data went out 4 a min\nFriend: Elias Salvador called you.\nPersona: I will finish the proposal tommorow a bit tired today\nPersona: ugh this proposal is a mental block to me\nPersona: cause idk how it should look and I feel anxious\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: data couch on character ai?\nFriend: Date\nFriend: Ella\nPersona: ohhh\nPersona: I misread data\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: Kota - daylight\nFriend: Listen to 0:40 to 0:45\nPersona: :DDDDD\nPersona: Why would one ask this even in the altenative meaning? \"I wonder if my dad hangs out with me?\"\nPersona: Or it means \"get along with?\"\nPersona: still you don't need to wonder, you know that :D\nFriend: yeah get along with more\nnot hang out with\nFriend: getting along is a good alternative for fuck with\nFriend: get along good\nPersona: Alright\nPersona: I would not use it with someone unless they know the meaning of it\nFriend: but i think it's not easy to know sometimes \n\nlike we hang out less time f.ex. but at some point maybe you think I start being too much gme conspiracy and not interesting for you to be friends with\n\nbut you would'nt say it outright so we just meet less and less and you avoid going out f.ex. with me\n\nbut because it hasnt been said out loud I can't know if there is something wrong and if you get along with me still\nFriend: yeah :D\nPersona: hm, in that hypothetical situation yeah, I agree question makes sense\nFriend: bruuh\nbe happy your boss is not writing you\nFriend: mine started writing me\nFriend: and he is super micro managing\nFriend: I found out there is even a coined term for it from the colleagues\n\nthe famous \"non confrontational discussion\"\nFriend: 1 hour we argue when do i work\nPersona: damn\nPersona: Xdd\nPersona: it happened to me too\nPersona: For two yeara I am recording each minute of my work on google sheets\nPersona: for each task\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I think just where we are and what we're doing\nFriend: alright\nFriend: we can do that as a quick chat\nFriend: i won\u2019t be done with my part before the evening tho i need to be done with training hope that\u2019s ok\nFriend: So evening it is or what ?\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\nFriend: Uo to you guys\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\nPersona: okay\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\nFriend: Oh wow\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\nFriend: Ok\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\nPersona: Do you want to call?\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\nPersona: nice article\nPersona: it looks so good\nPersona: character ai can't write code, it sucks at it. Only sometime it works\nPersona: are you joining me 17:00 at Station for this?\nFriend: im wet and tired\nwill study for tomorrow because im meeting with colleague to work on exam\nFriend: not in network mood today x__x\nFriend: but have fun\nPersona: alright\nFriend: I wanted to skip the sauna cause it became a bit much for me\nFriend: also double booked a study session\nPersona: alright\nPersona: maybe imma skip then too\nPersona: met this hot italian chich who is about to found a startup for womens underwear\nPersona: can it get hotter than that?\nFriend: fuck :DD\nFriend: you watched to much wolf of wallstreet\nPersona: bro this movie makes me move\nPersona: also generally this event had cool people\nPersona: also sometimes I talk to some person, I find them only midly interesting and then it becomes hard to lose them, so I'been thinking of ways how to excuse myself without appearing rude\nPersona: and going for a vape outside is good\nPersona: then when I reenter I approach new person\nFriend: but you gotta do it extra tactical\nPersona: how?\nFriend: like tell them it was nice\nbut you'll go for a vape\nand maybe youll talk again\nFriend: or some shit like that \n\nthat doesn't necessarily mean you talk again\n\nbut also doesn't stop it abruptly to make them feel \"this guy more interested in vape than networking\"\nPersona: yeah true\nPersona: I should leave some hook\nPersona: technique #2 inspired by you: engage another person standing next to, and leave them together talking\nPersona: :DDD\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: been wanting to do it for a while\nand it might help in some ways.. lets see\nPersona: Alright, lets talk about it live\nFriend: Lu willcome with her brother\nFriend: I think i shouls go shop\nFriend: Should i get my laptop\nFriend: Starting to worry if ppl will be hungry\nMovie is long\nMaybe i should get pizzas\nPersona: you should, we might need two, to relay Toby\nPersona: we go together at 17\nPersona: I just got out of shower\nPersona: I am lazy xd\nFriend: ok\nPersona: Okay\nPersona: omw\nFriend: you mean im omw?\nFriend: should i go\nPersona: to lidl\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: im in lidl\nFriend: Lu in front in 1min\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nFriend: Have discord on phone\nFriend: omww to work soon but wont be done for preparty\nPersona: skip pre party\nPersona: me too\nPersona: I will go straith after lecture\nPersona: gloria\nFriend: I'm taking a new approach to job/internship search\nFriend: I will let the chatbot create my CV\nFriend: you inspired me man\n\nI really think the character.ai thing is using ChatGPT from OpenAI\nFriend: I actually could use it for all my communication\n\nEveryone from now on will talk with ChatGPT instead of me\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: wait that was ambiguous, I have stuff I need to do on these days. other than that I should be free\nPersona: I am pretty sure I can adapt to be free most of these days\nPersona: would be ideal so somehow induce the same 3 AM conversation type, preferably ealier haha\nPersona: maybe 23rd\nPersona: ohh\nPersona: Even tho I read this, my brain disregarded it \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: you are busy every single weekend. Damn you must going out a lot\nPersona: I wanted to sneak into ITU scroll bar for a while - they state they only allow itu students. I think they are only available on fridays though\nPersona: what are the things you wanted to do for a while, that can be doable together?\nPersona: cause all I can think is stupid or kinda lame \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Ahhh so close, I will try to apply again in some other extraordinary method\nFriend: I see that we're equally skilled at reading comprehension \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: what, you've found another 5 disorders you think you have and you need me to tell you that you don't?\nFriend: not really, but I work both days until ~17, and since it's a people job, there's about 50% chance that I'll be an asshole by the end of the day depending on how busy it is\nFriend: so if I do make plans, it's the ones that I can bail on without disrupting the whole activity\nFriend: you are really passionate about that nerd hunting\nFriend: what's there. I know nothing about itu\nFriend: hm I don't know. I'd have to think about it\nPersona: reading comprehension xddd\nPersona: cracked me up\nPersona: yeah, precisely\nPersona: or just\nPersona: you are very unique to talk to\nPersona: ah. But also I can handle asshole. As you would assume, I have to deal with 100 of them at school everyday anyways.\nPersona: where do you work?\nPersona: oh you would not imagine\nPersona: I am going to ITU tommorow at 16 with my classmate for open days\nPersona: Plan is to scout masters programs, but most importantly, tame some nerds, so they can bring us to the scroll bar - the nerd hive.\nPersona: Because the Scroll bar instagram staff got passive aggresssive in terms of answering to my requests to come on some friday. I asked a couple of times and instead of replying they posted this\nPersona: I was thinking of a few options to comment\na) I don't have any friends from ITU. can I register myself?\nb) I dare myself to ask a random student in the campus to sign me up. Can I get a free beer then?\nc)  deadlock exception, since my ITU friend count is 0 and can't instantiate any without connecting to scroll bar ITU friend factory. Pls patch, thx.\nf) can somebody pls sign me up? I will buy you 10 beers (the number may or may not be expressed in binary, I am not sure yet)\n\nbut I will not comment anything, may our minds be entertained by the fictitious conversations each of the options would have created\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ah we need connections\nPersona: its chicken or the egg problem\nPersona: I was thinking of a few options to comment\na) I don't have any friends from ITU. can I register myself?\nb) I dare myself to ask a random student in the campus to sign me up. Can I get a free beer then?\nc)  deadlock exception, since my ITU friend count is 0 and can't instantiate any without connecting to scroll bar ITU friend factory.

I will buy you 10 beers (the number may or may not be expressed in binary, I am not sure yet)\n\nbut I will not comment anything, may our minds be entertained by the fictitious conversations each of the options would have created\nFriend: c is good af\n\nnot everyone there good at code tho. Has a bit of luck involved too\nPersona: I think they coddeee\nFriend: f good af too\nFriend: yeah man.. we code in KEA too\n\nhalf ppl still don't know wtf is an INT i guarantee :D\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: yeah deadlock is advanced topic, a factory and object instantiation also advanced vocab\nFriend: imagine the msc acceptance board goes to the bar\n\nyou might just get yourself automatically accepted for a master with that comment\nPersona: maybe I shoot them both haha I am getting tempted\nPersona: I am unlikely doing masters at ITU\nPersona: low chance\nPersona: but will check out\nFriend: cause can't fulfil req?\nPersona: um, partly\nPersona: but mostly cause DTU program sounds better, plus its DTU\nFriend: If you do it, I think f and a most success chance\nPersona: a?\nPersona: or c you mean?\nPersona: I would go for both, F and C\nFriend: just a straight up question if outsiders can join (because of chicken egg problem)\n\na) I don't have any friends from ITU. can I register myself?\nPersona: yeah this one is just asking for pity xd\nFriend: I think C would get you highest success chance, if there is a programmer that reads that\nFriend: high risk high reward one :D\nPersona: I think if they read and dont code, they will send to someone else to see wtf this dude wrote here\nFriend: but maybe they ain't so stupid as I think.. it's msc afterall\nPersona: If I get to have someone sign me up tommorow for this friday, should I sign up you too?\nFriend: hmm getting complicated now\nFriend: yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: nice\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\nPersona: yo wtf\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\nPersona: click the three dots\nPersona: and there is install app button\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\nPersona: thats pretty cool\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\nPersona: and mortgages\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\nPersona: this is from a book\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\nPersona: thats a CV\nPersona: You are hired!\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try"

Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: environment hostility wise, woundnt all other planets suck?\nPersona: or Venus is somehow extra naughty?\nPersona: okay you are right, I would not be drinking then. I could be sipping non alcoholic pina colada or cola maybe\nPersona: so you only talk to me as a manager? \ud83d\ude22 Should I start looking for a luxury rooftop hot tub and start crying about my loneliness already?\nPersona: Sometimes I forget you are polish\nPersona: you seem to cocealing your inner polish quite well\nPersona: to be*\nPersona: I tried this btw. I think it might be working\nFriend: full 3 min version? because this is gold, you're missing out otherwise \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: oof, no, this is tricky socially. I don't know if there's a way out of this other than somewhat concerned 'oh okay'\nFriend: or deflect with a question\nFriend: I mean, as much as neurodivergence is celebrated these days, I'm sure every parents wants nothing more than for their kid to be healthy and have a life as easy as possible which is not exactly the case here\nFriend: it is. it's referred to as hell planet for a reason. that's not the right vibe\nFriend: milk! like a psychopath\nFriend: yeah no, you just don't know me very well haha\nFriend: I'm proud :')\nFriend: oh look. now you can cry whenever and wherever you want!\nPersona: Shampoo, bathtub and a sponge. Thats a whole depression cure kit \ud83d\ude31\nFriend: but no Pitbull :/\nPersona: How flat do you need to be on the ground for your famous depression repelling ritual, and is pivko neccessary?\nPersona: I am afraid lack of Pitbull might not be the only issue here\nPersona: I think so, I will see again\nPersona: ok I didnt before xddd\nPersona: but now I did xd\nPersona: I cant believe this is real autism. It cant be that bad come on\nPersona: With some spacer level advanced life support a hell environment would be THE vibe. You there crying in your nanotech-anti-gravity-force-field suit, while an apocalypse is raging outside. A perfect contrast, or perhaps a perfect reflection\nPersona: I need to do this sometime as a social experiment\nPersona: during a night out, pull out some a milk bottle, pour it in the glass, drink it and say no word\nPersona: (without polish hazelnut vodka)\nPersona: I must meet a polish Joanna\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Oh fuck yeah\nFriend: Im omw home and will see as soon as i can\nFriend: they haven't posted the jobs openings yet, have they :?\nFriend: I don't have lectures friday btw. Can try to go to work early so I can finish. Depending on when friday bar is\nPersona: yeah, I will ask the VP\nPersona: will ask now sorry\nFriend: no worries \nnot in a hurry \n\nwould be interesting to see what they need\nPersona: just asked to send me the job posting\nPersona: so he will probably do it tommorow at work\nPersona: I will let u know\nPersona: btw tommorow Im going to ITU 16:00 if you want to join\nFriend: tuesday bar or what is happening\nFriend: I can be free!\nPersona: Open days for masters\nFriend: I don't think I'll go there for msc but would be down to join if ok\nFriend: o nice\nwe need to register for the friday bar and then no worries to get in?\nPersona: XDDDDD\nPersona: I asked them so vigorously they made a post\nPersona: no no\nPersona: Somebody needs ro register us\nFriend: ah we need connections\nPersona: its chicken or the egg problem\nPersona: I was thinking of a few options to comment\na) I don't have any friends from ITU. can I register myself?\nb) I dare myself to ask a random student in the campus to sign me up. Can I get a free beer then?\nc)  deadlock exception, since my ITU friend count is 0 and can't instantiate any without connecting to scroll bar ITU friend factory. Pls patch, thx.\nf) can somebody pls sign me up? I will buy you 10 beers (the number may or may not be expressed in binary, I am not sure yet)\n\nbut I will not comment anything, may our minds be entertained by the fictitious conversations each of the options would have created\nFriend: c is good af\n\nnot everyone there good at code tho. Has a bit of luck involved too\nPersona: I think they coddeee\nFriend: f good af too\nFriend: yeah man.. we code in KEA too\n\nhalf ppl still don't know wtf is an INT i guarantee :D\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: yeah deadlock is advanced topic, a factory and object instantiation also advanced vocab\nFriend: imagine the msc acceptance board goes to the bar\n\nyou might just get yourself automatically accepted for a master with that comment\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it.

If I just stand here and dont talk - I am a lower tier individual.\nPersona: lets skip this topic for now, I dont want to convince you of anything, I probably cant anyways. I just know thats this is the way for me personally now\nPersona: btw, what fun did you have awake at 3AM before Monday morning \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: ah okay. yup, it rings a bell\nFriend: what do you mean?\nFriend: hahah this does sound exactly like the inner monologue I would expect a sales person to have\nPersona: When one makes it big in life through STEM with the trade-off of being socially akward, then atleast it was worth it. If one is just socially akward without making it big, then why? Would better be social and enjoy the life seen in movies.\nPersona: I would low-key like to be like the technical co-founder billionaires, who got a lot of money being nerdy and now they are super rich but awkward. Yet, when you have big money to spend you have a social life in easy mode.\nPersona: I gotta tell you its a nice feeling. But I remember even when I had this mysterious abilitiy, it ceased to activate when work time ended. So for example when its 17 o' clock and the friday bar opens, I no longer have automatic conversations. Perhaps because I feel the pressure to do it.\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: will try to meet you when im free again\nFriend: I feel like chatgpt personal statements and letters are too posh\nFriend: if you have some time to read can I get your take\nFriend: I don't know if it's ok to call the programme BADB or use the full name\n\nI'm trying to save space cause max is 2 pages\nPersona: call it DB\nPersona: we call our DM\nPersona: I can read ir a bit l8er\nFriend: ok. Thanks!\nRefined version with calling it DB\nPersona: why is there a random hash in the name?\nFriend: XD I downloaded it like that\nwill rename\nFriend: is exchange the same as electives?\nFriend: I think its different\nPersona: pretty much\nPersona: Ok ChatGPT is very Posh at points\nPersona: I can even tell which parts I assume were writted by ChatGPT and you xd\nPersona: which is not a bad thing imo, cause using ChatGPT shows some skill in tech\nPersona: I marked the posh parts pink\nPersona: and added other comments\nPersona: green stuff is stuff I liked\nPersona: but for CBS, which does not allow use of it, may be a bad signal. idk\nPersona: Hard to tell\nPersona: It soudns a little insincere at posh parts. But CBS is a business school so life is insincere there generally\nFriend: thanks for the detailed marking :D\nI feel like this turned out to be a good letter\nPersona: np\nPersona: You got this\nPersona: I am trying to figure out why do I like my job so much. Work days pass so fast, I can't wait to go back.\n\nIn some ways it feels like I am running my own small startup there. I am fully in charge of the Website and partly of the tech stack surrounding it. I build the CMS and there are other people that use it - they are the users and CMS is my product. We all then collaborative build the website. Also, every single task is different and the variety of tasks is extreme. I am a part of the marketing department and I also work with most of other departments, sales, customer team, engineering team (for sparring, or when I use our own product for the website), design team, events. Maybe not the accounting/finance team, but that's fine. I also have extreme freedom in how I choose my tasks and prioritize them. Also, there are much less limits, compared to GROHE in what can be done.\nPersona: Maybe its just because I worked 2.5 years at GROHE\nPersona: the contrast is hard. But its been 6mo I am still overwhelmingly happy.\nPersona: is this the car scary thing?\nPersona: the page has no text info wtf\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: omg its actually so sad\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: idk if thats true what they are saying\nFriend: hahah\nPersona: You would need some quantitative analysis to really understand the majority\nFriend: BP could never win\nFriend: majority of what?\nPersona: yeah its a pretty shitty situation they are in\nPersona: Like whats the majority opinion on the actual gulf heatlh\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: Idk if this is important, but I dont mention it. In the tweets I selected, they are not really admitting their guilt still. They say \"business is good, look at how good the local businesses are around where we operate\", they never mentioned that they have 'fixed' or 'cleaned' or that something has 'improved:\nFriend: still in the second period??\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: its the same in the ads\nPersona: they never show any admittance\nPersona: they just say that the situation is 'very good' as they claim\nPersona: They don't explicitly deny it tho\nPersona: I did the twitter post analysis you can see\nPersona: Now I will take the TV\nPersona: Yo, maybe I should come to your place now, we can look at the TV ads together if you want and maybe you have some questions about the tweets?\nFriend: i am home in an hour approx then you can come\nPersona: okay\nFriend: i will text you when i am home i am in the train\nPersona: okay no worries\nFriend: i am home\nPersona: Whats your address?\nFriend: Absalonsgade 43\nFriend: first floor on the right\nPersona: Alrigjt coming\nFriend: Hi can you define the two periods in your part\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh wow, my business vocab got expanded yet again. you people have an acronym for everything\nFriend: oh I thought it's kind of a given too? what's even the alternative? that they could be a full time teacher or that they would work in the industry?\nPersona: JUST two wine glasses you say...\nPersona: well... Small BAC level is intuitively proven to increase non formal social performance\nPersona: So you are approching mainstream methods\nPersona: excuse me! LAN parties are great, they are a rarity. They also have DnD games at ITU\nPersona: our course meterial at CBS includes only dictonaries of acronyms that we have to learn. Thats all there is to it in a business bachelors\nPersona: I actually had an englighment about my interpretation of CBS as a university recently.\nPersona: I dont know too\nPersona: if you manage to see this text in the upcoming few hours, do you want to go to ITU scroll bar tonight?\nPersona: do you want to go to the craziest party in the craziest copenhagen kollegium tonight?\nFriend: hey, sorry. I was offline all weekend and probably will be missing for some time longer. I need to think\nPersona: what happened?\nPersona: Whats the thinking your doing? give me a TLDR\nPersona: Do you want to chat offline if you are going to be offline for a while? \ud83d\ude04\nFriend: frankly, not really - I don't really want to talk to anyone atm, but I realize that I do owe you that sometime soon\nPersona: Do you play games? there is one really interesting game that I keep coming back to that I think you would like. It's a simulation game with huge depth, including deep personalities of people, relationships, mental states. And its all set in a distant planet, where technologies range from tribal to advanced \"glitterworld\" mechanoid tech. Its called Rimworld\nPersona: If you are taking some time not talking to anyone I think you should try it\nPersona: because it's a singleplayer game (there is mod for multiplayer for those who insist)\nPersona: Would love to give you an intro to that game too or hear your stories playing it (the game calls itself story generator)\nFriend: oh wow nice timing. I literally thought 2 seconds ago that I should write to you to say sorry, because I'm being an asshole for no reason\nFriend: I can't talk rn, but will look at the rest in the evening\nPersona: all good\nPersona: and yeah look at that game in the evening if you have time\nFriend: my gamer girl career started and ended at sims 1 circa 2005\nFriend: so I understand nothing\nFriend: but it does seem that people reaaally love it\nPersona: no way ahahaha\nPersona: thats almost hard to believe. You havent played anything since?\nFriend: I probably played a bit of something online when I was a kid\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I took your idea about writing aplication to job with GPT\nPersona: GPT3 didn't work really well for me, but then chat gpt is helping out\nPersona: why google has those indians\nPersona: I am so racist holy shit\nPersona: but it sounds like a scam\nPersona: the whole presentation was boring though\nPersona: dissapointed in google\nFriend: how u not impressed of the tech\nPersona: Nothing beats chatgpt\nPersona: in that presentation\nFriend: a bit boring tho yeah\n\nshe is showing a coffe place and says \"its not really busy\" and the screen shows now is the bussiest time\nPersona: :DD\\\nPersona: this example specifically is kinda a bit stupid\nPersona: I mean, you literally see all of the coffee shops with your pure eye. Yeah it adds extra benefit of extra info, but I would not bother pulling out my phone for that. Thats maybe move applicable if we all walk with those google glasses\nPersona: or AR glasses\nPersona: But have you seen around 9 mins, they lost the phone xd?\nPersona: How long do you spent writing job application\nPersona: I been writing this one for like 5 hours\nPersona: but I have no writeen any for 3 months, so I kinda updte stuff, and this is a good shot I have cause I got recomended by my ex mentor for that\nPersona: I am literally so lucky I chose Rasa (the one from Talent Garden) as my mentor, she is really giving me good stuff\nFriend: one application? not that much\nFriend: 10 min max\nPersona: damn\nPersona: so quick\nFriend: chat gpt writes it mostly\nFriend: i just veto\nPersona: How do you use it to write?\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: i can show you\nPersona: hm. maybe after I finish this one, cause I really need to end it, I dont need new ideas or criticism, cause I this point I am totally overfitting in some local minima"

Its much easier to sell parties\nFriend: Ye\nFriend: See if you like\nPersona: I also asked the founder yesterday, thei techstack is firebase and flutter\nFriend: Nice\nFriend: U wanna program?\nPersona: nice\nPersona: Some band I like\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: cant decide whether I want to do some marketing or business side Or coding\nPersona: coding would be fun\nPersona: where is that?\nFriend: Austria\n\nNathalie and her sister drive from Germany\n\nCan tag along maybe\nFriend: All marketing people I've seen are bad at what they do imo\nFeel like you'll be too good\nPersona: hm hm, let me think about it\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI've seen very good\nPersona: but I was in the industry for a while and was working in an agency a bit\nPersona: our current action plan includes some guarilla tactics\nFriend: Oh if its agency maybe\nFriend: The inhouse marketing ive seen so far was bad tho\nFriend: Nice \ud83d\ude04\nPersona: a lot of marketing also feels fake and spam\nPersona: but selling parties, houseparties sounds lit\nPersona: people want parties\nPersona: people want people\nFriend: Yeah\nWould be more fun to sell that than a sallary platform\nPersona: ahaha yes\nPersona: xddd\nPersona: omg\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so there are some differences then that you found\nFriend: in this particular case it's not very telling because we didn't see any correlation with behaviour\nFriend: but read the first paragraph here\nPersona: like entrepreneurs show a higher dmpfc activation when it comes to getting rewards for oneself, while managers show higher activation when the rewards is not for them. If you had you translate this to a general business newspaper article headline, how would it sound?\nPersona: okay give me a sec\nFriend: this for example could indicate that higher activation is related to decision efficiency\nPersona: ok it kind of vaguely answers my question I think\nFriend: not really. it just indicates that ent and man may be affected differently by decision context\nFriend: but still so what if it doesn't have effect on behaviour\nPersona: Is dmpfc high/low somehow related to exploration/explotation?\nPersona: exploitation*\nPersona: Even if there are no behavioral differences. if the brain activations are different that might show something about the difference between man and ent. Especially if I could know what those activations mean generally. Like if higher dmpfc activation is also present when eating ice cream during winter, then that might tell me that entrepreneurs taking risk has something in common with eating ice cream during winter\nPersona: the example is stupid\nPersona: but\nPersona: I hope you get the pount\nFriend: not to my knowledge. we investigated that region bc it has been shown previously that it may be involved in differentiation between decisions made for self and others (see 1st paragraph below). that's actually a useful result of our study bc it adds evidence to that hypothesis\nFriend: in a perfect world yes, but in reality it is possible that this effect is due to chance. fMRI is not a terribly reliable or replicable method, so take that with a rain of salt\nFriend: nothing is really this straightforward in neuroscience, but thats a long conversation\nPersona: google is being really helpful\nFriend: valence is just positive or negative\nPersona: ok so basically, I can't really raise the findings of your thesis above the neuroscience sea level, and it mostly concerns other neuroscience research. It can't show something to someone not in neuroscience yet.\nPersona: would that be right?\nFriend: I think that's a good way to look at it. it's useful for the sake of perfecting the methodology (both in terms of what to do and what not to do), but we haven't really come any closer to understanding what differentiates entrepreneurs from the gen. population\nPersona: okay, fair enough\nPersona: ty for the patience haha\nFriend: not gonna lie, choosing the post nye hangover day for discussing science is quite cruel of you \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: but you're very welcome\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yeah, work tommorow\nPersona: Man gotta skip tonight too, just came home and want to do some important thing for tommorow.

In this case I think it's best if we keep it casual and run  it on a friendly and fun tone rather than serious business. With Romanians it's always easy going\nPersona: ok, so we try to collaborate?\nFriend: 100% I'll reach out of the guy and see if he's open to pulling something off together\nPersona: Alright\nFriend: The other guys are busy with DJing for some company so I couldn't arrange a meeting with them yet but hopefully it will be soon\nPersona: Nice find, crazy you came across this guy\nFriend: Yeah it's wild\nPersona: idk, cant say much about that topic, dont have an opinion, both is good for me\nPersona: how approchable is he?

Progress is dead slow\nFriend: What's up baller are you out tonight\nPersona: Hey, nah, chilling home\nPersona: Thursday, friday daytime I am busy, but weekend I am up for it, for sure\nPersona: Make a vybe event\nPersona: I am.free after around 18\nPersona: Should we go clubbing first?\nFriend: You know im down G\nPersona: Yo buddy, I probably got some change of plans on Friday, so I can join you only late in the evening\nPersona: I been getting users to sign up on Vybe though whenever I can\nFriend: thats lit man lets make some event and invite a bunch of people from student groups\nFriend: just whatever outdoor drinking, music, games, cristiania\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What date is it ?\nPersona: saturday\nPersona: Come to our party\nPersona: its happening in an hour\nPersona: bring dana\nPersona: You called Denis.\nFriend: You missed a call from Denis.\nFriend: U have my adress ?\nFriend: I can join for few hours\nPersona: The video chat ended.\nPersona: send address\nFriend: Bispeparken 42\nPersona: here\nPersona: like last time\nPersona: You called Denis.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: You called Denis.\nPersona: u got in?\nFriend: Clozing\nFriend: What kitchen ?\nFriend: Can u open ?\nFriend: For us ?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: bri\nPersona: u good\nPersona: where r u?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: Hey man, how are you?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think we should go to the Monday CineWine thing. Its obv also on put on another platform, where most visitors will come and we can come there saying we found this on Vybe, so other will be curious about it\nPersona: hmm\nPersona: In dk we probably need a hangar or smth, cause its a less of a house party culture\nPersona: Could be a good way to get users on Vybe. We get users, plus we make some money\nPersona: How do the ppl in Poland do it? When they do these paid houseparties, do they allow alcohol in, or they also host a bar to earn money?\nPersona: I might also need to look around the regulationn around this\nPersona: Also see if I could find anyonr who tried it in denmark\nPersona: fuck idk if I can go to the wine thing. I have a fucky exam deadline friday\nPersona: Can you make it?\nFriend: man i forgot about this wine shit, too deep at work\nPersona: well, next time, hope they host again\nPersona: Should we do reffen on saturday?\nFriend: Let's fucking go\nFriend: man sorry that I didn't tell you much. I'm really pissed off with the ''CEO'' because he is incompetent and unprofessional\nPersona: no worries mab\nPersona: man*\nPersona: whats on your mind regarding the further plan?\nPersona: lets talk about this tommorow, I started party a bit early today\nPersona: Whats your plan today?\nFriend: What's up G\nFriend: We're going to the beach and then let's do reffen\nPersona: I am going to the norrebro block party thing, but I have some family time in between at 17, but then evening free\nFriend: Perfect sounds good\nFriend: When is that event you told me about\nPersona: Jumping to water at islands sounds pretty good actually\nPersona: I dont know about any specific activities, I also just remembered that in cph its common to hand out at parks\nFriend: Frisbee at the park would be lit\nFriend: And beer bong\nPersona: lets try\nPersona: so I have a family dinner now, but later in the evening maybe 21 im down to go to reffen, werkstat\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\nPersona: nice article\nPersona: it looks so good\nPersona: character ai can't write code, it sucks at it.

Thats god damn good I think\nPersona: we should go to poland, hit some big vybe party\nFriend: I think that's bound to happen by now\nPersona: What is this group for mainly? Business topics without spam?\nFriend: Networking with people who want to win\nFriend: I will text an intro soon to explain\nFriend: Just wanna get some more people first\nPersona: cool, I saw intro in Telegram\nFriend: More coming\nPersona: Yo man, I saw you requesting but its sold out\nPersona: You are free to drop by talk outside\nFriend: Where are u at now? My boys are DJing in meatpacking\nPersona: Im same place as on Vybe\nPersona: but I am not staying out long tonight\nPersona: Yo homie, I am having a few ideas here\nPersona: A weekend trip to Mons klint maybr around 23rd - 25 June\nPersona: and end of July trip to Chalupy, a beuatiful town in peninsula in Poland. Do some kite-surfing there. I am planning that with Partyk currently and some other people seem in\nPersona: any thoughts?\nPersona: no no for poland its not 23rd june\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nPersona: yeah, I am trying to convince him that funneling pressurized air through straws will increase the GPU cooling effectiveness by 30%, resulting in faster model training speeds\nPersona: I think it makes total sense. Otherwise it would be strange\nPersona: Now you are too kind\nFriend: and that's without cheating? time to rethink career choices. your powers are getting wasted on the smart stuff\nFriend: apparently there's even a douchebag manual in case you need some extra guidance\nFriend: on top of that, this will stop him from talking for a moment. well played sir\nFriend: perhaps. they would be too powerful if they had people skills as well\nFriend: let's see if you'll still hold that view once the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate\nPersona: hey how are you? how do you feel with tommorows interview\nPersona: sorry had a terribly busy week and I am just terrible at chatting xd\nPersona: weirdly, but I learnt some/many of these things are if not neccesary then very effective at climbing the ladder\nPersona: Some are bad and ineffective, but I feel this guide can actually be effective ahaha\nPersona: like at work for example, you have to get noticed not only by your manager, but by manager's manager. You really have to make sure that your skill is noticed\nPersona: This guide really reminds me of Lithuanian older generation\nPersona: Also after reading this guide I realized I also had a wrong understanding of 'arrogant'\nPersona: With your help I will redefine my whole vocab\nPersona: I think this evening I had the most social experience in our anti-social kitchen\nPersona: 4 of us were holding an inclusive conversation for a considerable time\nPersona: Good luck today!\nPersona: How did it go?"

Text below:\nConversations between persona and friends\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Apprently you can create a git repository in a Google Drive folder\nPersona: But\nPersona: since I like to learn stuff, I will find a workaround\nPersona: I will do the script later, I got a little bit annoyed while bulding it\nPersona: For now I will manually move items to it from time to time\nFriend: Ill be at DS 12 w/ u\nPersona: alright\nPersona: wya?\nPersona: oh fuck\nPersona: I am.in wronf one\nFriend: 2.08 In 1 sec\nPersona: btw in case you missed it, I shared the cases with you on a G drive invite\nPersona: The first case is super cool tho\nFriend: I saw thx\nFriend: Just finished it. It sure sounds like an interesting org 2 work in!\nFriend: I\u2019ll sit by the left side\nFriend: Plz bring a charger\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nPersona: Hey, I have been looking (a abit today, felt a bit bad) into the market research methods, also specifically into few, but will look more into it. I think focus groups is a solid choice but I already found some alternatives, and maybe there can be more.\nPersona: Its still WIP, but see some of the methodologies I mapped in my notes (linked to the For Elias) part\nPersona: I pushed to repo\nPersona: Hey, I'll skip the class today, cause I am a little sick\nFriend: I'll check it out. I've been thinking a lot about how we will present a certain product 2 the digital personas, and I feel like it's going to be challenging 2 not embed bias. Do u have any idea about that?\nFriend: Why is it it's called WIP?\nFriend: I'll share my notes. Hope u feel better soon!<3\nFriend: git config --global alias.cp '!git add . && git commit -m \"Quick update\" && git push'\nFriend: git config --global alias.up 'pull origin main'\nFriend: Here is 2 alias scripts. Put them into your terminal. So u from now on only need 2 \"cd\" into your local version of the repo, and then write \"git cp\" to share yours, and \"git up\" to get mine;)\nPersona: well, a persona must be biast by definition I would assume\nPersona: if you are 0 biast, then you are just a general person, not really a persona\nPersona: Or what kind of bias did you mean?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm having huge confirmation bias now because I see it the same way\nFriend: don't know a girl that I can get an opinion from that I can trust with taht\nPersona: Maybe because we see women in similar way. But ask someone else too if you need more thoughts\nPersona: hmmm. Maybe Luiza?\nFriend: need to be super careful with analyzing her answer because she is always positive :DD\nPersona: or idk maybe even go with the flow, keep looking for other girls. I mean if you need so much of opinions what do others think about it, then maybe you are just forcing yourself to like her. When you actually like/love a girl, it shows clearly.\nFriend: I wonder how her brother would think because he was very religious and has a pure take sometimes\n\nbut honestly don't really want to know. Feel like the only social approval I need is my parents xD\nPersona: Lol I do also seek approval from my dad secretely\nPersona: but he has old fashioned perception of woman\nPersona: holy shit yesterday I had crazy experience\nPersona: I was hanging out with this ukrainian neighbour and his hot wife and we were cooking chiken, then we all ate the chiken and I was trying to wash my plate when suddenly she came and took my plate from me to wash it herself, like I was doing smth wrong by washing it on my own xddd\nPersona: And because they are like older, this Denis dude is 28 and his wife idk maybe 26, they talk in russian sounding language, gives me parent vibes\nFriend: feel like I can't get out of that one. I'll need them on board with what I decide \n\nand I don't want to fight them\nPersona: But for me its like very insignificant. Its more that I am curious of what he thinks about a girl rather than concerned.\nPersona: But maybe you have some different relationship with your parents.\nFriend: ppl get annoyed when you touch i their kitchen in a different way than they are used to xD\nI feel the same about some people trying to wash stuff\nPersona: But it was shared kitchen and it was my own plate and even my own chicken\nFriend: that's weird then\nFriend: funny experience\nPersona: She just sraiight up asserted female submission and took the plate\nPersona: multicultural experience\nFriend: asserted female submission \ud83e\udd23\nPersona: you have to check this one girl on IG. She is like the proof that naturally a girl can be really ugly in face proportions, size, evrything. But appear super hot and be wanted by men so much if they have the confidence\nPersona: She is a photographer also so she can take best pictures on herself\nPersona: but in stories and some photos you can see that she is kind of egh.\nPersona: this fact keeps amazing me\nFriend: there are two big reasons I see why\nFriend: she looks to me like she is disguisted by what she sees in many photos\nPersona: by what she seees? what do you mean?\nPersona: disguised?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: The most stressfull part is when your best colonist is about to bleed out in 1 hour and you are hoping a medic can patch them up just in time\nPersona: or when somebody gets an infection and the immunity build up rate has to surpass the infection rate\nPersona: thats real stress\nPersona: but I don't think about that\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is not getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is now getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison (edited)\nFriend: sounds unreal\nwhen you describe things like that I imagine it's some Red dead redemption graphics kind of game\nFriend: but with even more freedom in choice what to do\nPersona: but you get this graphic\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\nFriend: i get this\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\nPersona: well almost applied\nPersona: I am confused. I have the legal right for Digital Business masters\nPersona: so what do I put in the personal statement field. Its required\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\nPersona: thats a CV\nPersona: You are hired!\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\nPersona: nice article\nPersona: it looks so good\nPersona: character ai can't write code, it sucks at it. Only sometime it works\nPersona: are you joining me 17:00 at Station for this?\nFriend: im wet and tired\nwill study for tomorrow because im meeting with colleague to work on exam\nFriend: not in network mood today x__x\nFriend: but have fun\nPersona: alright\nFriend: I wanted to skip the sauna cause it became a bit much for me\nFriend: also double booked a study session\nPersona: alright\nPersona: maybe imma skip then too\nPersona: met this hot italian chich who is about to found a startup for womens underwear\nPersona: can it get hotter than that?\nFriend: fuck :DD\nFriend: you watched to much wolf of wallstreet\nPersona: bro this movie makes me move\nPersona: also generally this event had cool people\nPersona: also sometimes I talk to some person, I find them only midly interesting and then it becomes hard to lose them, so I'been thinking of ways how to excuse myself without appearing rude\nPersona: and going for a vape outside is good\nPersona: then when I reenter I approach new person\nFriend: but you gotta do it extra tactical\nPersona: how?\nFriend: like tell them it was nice\nbut you'll go for a vape\nand maybe youll talk again\nFriend: or some shit like that \n\nthat doesn't necessarily mean you talk again\n\nbut also doesn't stop it abruptly to make them feel \"this guy more interested in vape than networking\"\nPersona: yeah true\nPersona: I should leave some hook\nPersona: technique #2 inspired by you: engage another person standing next to, and leave them together talking\nPersona: :DDD\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: nice\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\nPersona: yo wtf\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\nPersona: click the three dots\nPersona: and there is install app button\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\nPersona: thats pretty cool\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\nPersona: and mortgages\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\nPersona: this is from a book\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get.

I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: A: I think that lazy clearly shows that the person is reluctant to do finance because its too much effort.\n\nB: But not interested is more that they are not interested in the topic itself. \n\nSo I think those are related, but so you can be not lazy and take care of finances, but do it because of necessity and not be stoked about it.\nPersona: Maybe thats too deep lol\nPersona: idk\nPersona: Target sounds weird when you put it into this sentence\nFriend: ://\nFriend: Then idk\nPersona: Chat GPT suggest this, but idk, I don't like this instantly\nFriend: i will jnust mention the 3 most prominent in terms of numbers of times it ways said... \n\nOh and for personas thats basically just this right? Discribing the people that we are targeting like fx Santana\nPersona: For big goal, maybe if you add \"Savings targets\". then it sounds a lil better.\nPersona: Or for weekly ones \"Weekly Challenges.\", but that then sounds more daunting\nFriend: Yeah no challenges\nPersona: \"Smart Savings\" is a nice idea GPT gave for the weekly goals. But not sure.\nPersona: Would be cool to have some catchy name\nPersona: Jesus christ\nPersona: what is this sorcery\nFriend: ahhahah holy shit\nFriend: They are all bad\nPersona: no debate, i think perfect name is \"Savings Supercharged Stints\"\nPersona: 100%\nPersona: SAVING SUPERCHARGED STINTS\nFriend: Frugal fun frenzies is fucking funny\nFriend: But these names are cringe and long\nFriend: Dollar Dynamo Tasks is def one of my favs\nPersona: Byte-goals\n\"Choose your next Byte-goal for this week.\"\nFriend: But why byte\nFriend: It\u2019s not a byte\nPersona: Fuck I am putting too much into into this\nPersona: I feel stupid. ChatGPT is giving super cringe stuff now. And I am bothering you with this nonsense lol\nFriend: Feel free to but don\u2019t get too caught up on it\nFriend: can u just give me your thoughts on this bc i feel like i am almost just reciting from the insights we gained from empathizing and idk how to feel abt that"

I think focus groups is a solid choice but I already found some alternatives, and maybe there can be more.\nPersona: Its still WIP, but see some of the methodologies I mapped in my notes (linked to the For Elias) part\nPersona: I pushed to repo\nPersona: Hey, I'll skip the class today, cause I am a little sick\nFriend: I'll check it out. I've been thinking a lot about how we will present a certain product 2 the digital personas, and I feel like it's going to be challenging 2 not embed bias. Do u have any idea about that?\nFriend: Why is it it's called WIP?\nFriend: I'll share my notes.

Im home atm\nMaybe we go tofetber\nFriend: 22 i meant the day\nFriend: Cause you sais you busy\nPersona: yYeah I understood\nPersona: I am busy until 2023-06-22\nFriend: Sankt hans on 2023-06-23 \nI think\nPersona: thats my plan for 23rd\nPersona: So if its after idk, maybe 20:00 hours I can join\nFriend: Aah\nFriend: Yeah!\nFriend: Lets do that together then!

They are there just to include a reference to satisfy teachers, but it will just make them mad\nPersona: She studies MSc information systems in CBS and we met cause I asked if she could share her xp with that course\nPersona: That was only one opinion, but it seemed like this course at CBS not what I want because its too non-technical, the actual coding you do is same as BSc level we did at Digital Managment. Its mostly management stuff, but she hardly applied it at her work as a scrum master in Orsted, where she manages IT system dev.\nPersona: I can tell you more about it if you are contemplating this program, but today I almost fully decided that I am not taking MSc IS\nPersona: But we talked a bunch about ITU and ITU actually seems like a place. At ITU they really do and learn shit. She said what we learned in whole year for programming at CBS, that was like 1mo at ITU. She said at ITU you have no life.\nPersona: Which I like, because what we learn at CBS is ehhh, you can be very lazy and still pass. Its about the connections and the brand where CBS is nice.\nPersona: I think I will look more into Software Architect, that actually might be a good place to be for me. But that's not at CBS prob.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: it's called perron\nPersona: hm. its not working. Try thinking in different pose\nFriend: will try\nPersona: okay, try that one, will you?\nPersona: I bet you will come up with th best ideas\nPersona: btw, great success today - made friends with two ITU people that will sign me up for Scroll bar\nPersona: I also had a great laugh from this italian data science professor, he kept using the adjective Ultra. Sometimes for him things very even ultra ultra something. Me and my friend my a bet whether he will say \"giga\" and then we also made a bet that if he said ultra ultra ultra (3 time), I would stand up and correct him, that in this case he should say giga.\nPersona: But none of that happen. We concluded that his best one was \"ultra stellar\"\nPersona: made*\nPersona: but I concluded I will probably not apply to ITU\nFriend: why\nPersona: I think one of the programmes at DTU will be better\nFriend: shit, sorry. I was a bit drunk yesterday, and apparently overconfident that I can multi-task during a pee break\nFriend: tbh that why took all the power of my remaining 1.5 brain cells and a headstand\nFriend: but what's the vibe of people there in general? I don't hear anything about that school ever, except that it exists\nFriend: hahah was he so hyped up about itu or about data science?\nFriend: I'm def stealing this one\nFriend: you know, I never really go open days bc I feel like it doesn't really represent the place accurately, i.e. everything seems 1000x better than in reality\nFriend: but I've always wondered whether I'm missing out or not\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: if I can do it (done it in the past successfully), then you should definetely be able to\nPersona: just pee longer\nPersona: Xdddd\nPersona: how much ethanol intoxitacion did you have? \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: although if you did a headstand... well, a short accidental headstand could very well be a symptom of high ethanol intoxication, so its possible I guess\nPersona: yeah, its quite rare to meet the ITU species. Vybe is nerdier, my best discovery was that they host occassional LAN parties (everybody brings they gaming rigs to school and play League, csgo, etc tournaments all night while drinking energy drinks)\nPersona: That I would like to participate abd I got conctacts\nPersona: but I think to find out the real vibe, an experiential visit to the scroll bar must be done. And we already made some connections there that will add us to the guest list this friday. So for that you will have to come with me and find out \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: I think the combination, he kept emphasizing (ultraemphasizing) that its so ultra ultra cool that the lecturers who teach each data science course are also active reaearchers in these topics\nPersona: I kinda took it for granted at CBS, but he was positioning it as a real USP (Unique selling point)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what is original idea and your idea?\nFriend: This is yours\nPersona: I think daily nudges is fine. Cause some ways to save mainly consists of don't. So daily-do's would limit the kind of nudges we can have.\nPersona: Whats the original?\nPersona: Without the goal?\nFriend: The initial think we talked about today. Where you can choose a weekly goal based on the multi-select question\nFriend: But then we have to decide if we want that to be a circle that reoccurs every week or how\nPersona: The 'change of scenarios' then should not be like a switch-button. If you don't set \"adidas shoes' goal', Then you are in scenario \"Original idea\". If you do set 'adidas shoes' goal, then you are in \"Your idea\" scenario. What do you think about that?\nFriend: so then i feel like being lazy and not into personla finance are kin dof in the same space as well bc they would take up a lot of people then.... I would make more sense to write that people are lazy and not into doing their personal finances rather than they dont care abt right? or am i fishing\nPersona: But the reason I am saying 'adidas shoes' goal is because there is a disambiguity between the two types of goals we are talking about. This is what I mean that we need to invest different words for that.\nFriend: Yes\nFriend: Hmm ok so different names of the goals\nFriend: But daily nudges doesn\u2019t sound that great either\nPersona: I think lazy and not into personal finance are different things.\nPersona: I think their are related\nFriend: Maybe the weekly ones could be targets and the specific ones you set yourself could be goals\nFriend: Like it\u2019s my target to spend less on beer and my goal to afford Adidas\nPersona: @Victoria I am still thinking about this lazy vs not interested\nFriend: i think u are right its not the same\nFriend: im just going to say \"not into doing their personal finances\"\nPersona: A: I think that lazy clearly shows that the person is reluctant to do finance because its too much effort.\n\nB: But not interested is more that they are not interested in the topic itself. \n\nSo I think those are related, but so you can be not lazy and take care of finances, but do it because of necessity and not be stoked about it.\nPersona: Maybe thats too deep lol\nPersona: idk\nPersona: Target sounds weird when you put it into this sentence\nFriend: ://\nFriend: Then idk\nPersona: Chat GPT suggest this, but idk, I don't like this instantly\nFriend: i will jnust mention the 3 most prominent in terms of numbers of times it ways said... \n\nOh and for personas thats basically just this right? Discribing the people that we are targeting like fx Santana\nPersona: For big goal, maybe if you add \"Savings targets\". then it sounds a lil better.\nPersona: Or for weekly ones \"Weekly Challenges.\", but that then sounds more daunting\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what methods did you discover?\nPersona: share them, I am interested for my own utility \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: spreadsheets?\nPersona: Hunger is so annoying like, idk what to ea\nPersona: eat*\nPersona: I am so bored of cooking and eating\nPersona: I wish to have like automatic eating\nFriend: Almost no spreadsheets. Just abusing google calendar and reporting daily to Kinga (it goes both ways). Perfect way to keep ourselves accountable and maintain long distance friendship \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: how did you manage to do assigments in a week after they are assigned? I would have big will power problems\nPersona: I've been lately experimenting a lot with calender too, come up with this one method, working good so far, but not mature to share yet\nPersona: Once a few weeks? :oooo\nPersona: Hm\nPersona: I do mass cooking every week, but I dont freeze stuff\nPersona: Shopping wise, hm perhaps I could try online\nPersona: maybe I should also try freezing\nPersona: Overall I feel like there is a lot in common that we do regarding this whole productivity theory\nFriend: I see them as something to \u201eget rid of\u201d xd Assignments are related to what we had on the lectures/classes. Doing the them helps me understand the most important concepts and I don\u2019t have to study that much later on.\nFriend: As I said, my \u201ctechniques\u201d are no rocket science but it took me some time to build and adapt this mindset\nFriend: Yeah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m only eating frozen meals but the thing is that I don\u2019t have to cook if I don\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s why I also mentioned having ingredients for all of the basic and quick meals.\nFor me it\u2019s mainly oatmeal, pasta and miso soup. I can make these in around 15min so I don\u2019t consider it as \u201ccooking\u201d\nFriend: Oh and also, with my lifestyle it\u2019s very inconvenient to do it differently. As I have a few projects going on, there\u2019s more important and fun stuff to worry about than throwing all nighters to do some assignments ;) that\u2019s the engine for my will power\nPersona: a nice danish song\nPersona: with english part\nPersona: ugh, yeah, but they are usuallly at low urgency after they get assigned\nPersona: I stopped eating oatmeal rn. I got too bored finally\nFriend: I\u2019m preparing for a hybrid way of living that I wish to have. Soo being able to work and study anywhere anytime? Check. Having (almost) no fresh produce in the fridge? Check. Minimising the amount of stuff that I own? Check.\n\nHaving all that brings me lots of convenience and peace\nPersona: true, the goal of this semester for now is to not have any allnighters\nPersona: its the bane of my will to live\nFriend: So be the one who creates that urgency. Treat yourself with doing more important things after you get rid of those\nPersona: that is a nice setup\nFriend: I have classes only on some of the weekends so usually I start working on notes and assignments in the evenings during the weekend or on the first few days after that(for bigger assignments). Is it tiring? Yes. But does it pay off? Very much\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: ok so basically, I can't really raise the findings of your thesis above the neuroscience sea level, and it mostly concerns other neuroscience research. It can't show something to someone not in neuroscience yet.\nPersona: would that be right?\nFriend: I think that's a good way to look at it. it's useful for the sake of perfecting the methodology (both in terms of what to do and what not to do), but we haven't really come any closer to understanding what differentiates entrepreneurs from the gen. population\nPersona: okay, fair enough\nPersona: ty for the patience haha\nFriend: not gonna lie, choosing the post nye hangover day for discussing science is quite cruel of you \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: but you're very welcome\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\nFriend: we were just having drinks and playing board games until 6 in the morning\nFriend: how was yours?\nPersona: the fireworks weren't that good here haha, I was also home\nPersona: I had literallly the most chill too\nPersona: I felt a bit sick so stayed home, talked with friends on discord\nPersona: So I am alive and healthy today, apart from having an inverse daynight cycle for the past wekk\nFriend: oh god, I'm so sick of those. it felt like going through a war zone when I was biking to the dorm from home\nFriend: aw shame I didn't know. you could've joined us\nFriend: glad it's nothing serious. you're coming back to school already or you're having a longer Christmas break?\nPersona: isn't the bass you feel in your chest after an explosion kind of thrilling to you?\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: bruuh\nbe happy your boss is not writing you\nFriend: mine started writing me\nFriend: and he is super micro managing\nFriend: I found out there is even a coined term for it from the colleagues\n\nthe famous \"non confrontational discussion\"\nFriend: 1 hour we argue when do i work\nPersona: damn\nPersona: Xdd\nPersona: it happened to me too\nPersona: For two yeara I am recording each minute of my work on google sheets\nPersona: for each task\nPersona: i got used to it to the point where I started to like it\nFriend: that's good stuff\nPersona: I can also see when my boos looks at it cause google sheets shows\nFriend: :DD\nFriend: did he shut up when he saw the sheet?\nPersona: he comes sometimes, to check what I am busy of\nPersona: Its for my secirity\nPersona: cause when he asks, you been working 8 hours that day, but only 5 hours in this, what else did you do\nPersona: then I look and 3 other hours was emails, filling some survey, replying to some SoMe comment\nPersona: etc\nPersona: so I have argument\nFriend: fukin micromanagers xD\nPersona: I got a task to make a video\nPersona: now I am editing video\nPersona: so kinda cool\nPersona: how much weeks you have left?\nFriend: work til end of january\nPersona: The intership is supposed to start on feb? or when?\nPersona: for KEA\nPersona: or they dont specify?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: although could just manually place , and decapitalize W\nPersona: bruh my work is taking over my mind. I can't focus on studying, I just keep thinking about work\nPersona: as if I am addicted to it.\nFriend: That is beautiful\n\nI loved my work at one point\nAnd my sidehustle\n\nEverything else was second\nFriend: I like that\nGood drive\n\nMaybe bad for relationship or others but i miss the feeling\nFriend: But hard if you think you want a good grade at studies\nPersona: bro, I spam you with so much random stuff and you still read it seriously\nPersona: I thank you for that <3\nPersona: Its the Lunar founder pitching lunar before it got popular\nPersona: dude Silicon Valley tv series is so good\nPersona: the italian is in germany for some wedding or smth, I am watching it alone and not telling it\nPersona: cause its so on point\nPersona: I am so immersed, so many moments are so good\nPersona: and when she comes back I will lovely watch it again pretending I didn't know, its just so good\nPersona: my highschool classmate\nPersona: how would you rate her out of 10?\nFriend: O nice to see the start\nFriend: It's insightful to see those services having to work with traditional finance to make it work\nFriend: I wonder how you make connection with traditional banks and convince them to make use of them in that way\nFriend: Because he did say they are eating their products\nFriend: No\nLooks like Corinne\nFriend: 7+ but really not my style so personally under 5\nPersona: ohh she so diff from corine in my mind. Also I guess the fact that I know her influences my perception\nFriend: Eastern European Corinne\nFriend: What is she working with\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: idk tbh\nPersona: she was just always hot for me\nPersona: What I call 'stupid hot bitches at CBS pretending to be smart'. I am probably relative the same to this guy\nPersona: whats ur thesis subj?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: alright, do that, and goodnight\nFriend: what do you do friday saturday? maybe we can meet\nPersona: nothing much, decided to not throw party for my bday thia year, a bit too busy\nPersona: lol\nFriend: Hey Airi! What are you doing Sunday?\nPersona: Idk actually, should I invite some of closest friends over?\nPersona: I am not sure\nFriend: Hell yeah!\nWho do you have in mind?\nFriend: I have metal forms for flan\nPersona: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f missed your call.\nPersona: you at work?\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nPersona: interview went great, think the marketinf manager, cto and hr liked me\nPersona: but they said there is.another tevhnical intetview later\nPersona: they will.call me after they sum up\nFriend: Airi! \nIf you feel celebrating with others I can give a hand and help setup\nWh\nPersona: Before I had an idea to host a great party at juste place like always with many people, but I though its too much for this time, already feeling too busy, maybe next year a big great party again \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: on my birthday I love to hang out with you though maybe just chill time. Wish Patryk was here too\nPersona: not feeling like hanging out with anyone from CBS though\nPersona: if we stay at my dorm then I could also invite the the ukrainian dude with his wife\nPersona: Now I am thinking about cake xd\nPersona: I will buy some nice cake from Meny\nPersona: Ok now I am thinking about just a casual hang out in my kitchen \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Maybe would be pretty nice to invite Kuba, Lu, maybe Ivan. But I am not feeling like I want much attention\nPersona: I want a low key chill evening xd\nPersona: but maybe that would work\nFriend: St Patricks day today\nFriend: What you up to\nPersona: work\nPersona: then relax home after"

Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\nPersona: nice article\nPersona: it looks so good\nPersona: character ai can't write code, it sucks at it. Only sometime it works\nPersona: are you joining me 17:00 at Station for this?\nFriend: im wet and tired\nwill study for tomorrow because im meeting with colleague to work on exam\nFriend: not in network mood today x__x\nFriend: but have fun\nPersona: alright\nFriend: I wanted to skip the sauna cause it became a bit much for me\nFriend: also double booked a study session\nPersona: alright\nPersona: maybe imma skip then too\nPersona: met this hot italian chich who is about to found a startup for womens underwear\nPersona: can it get hotter than that?\nFriend: fuck :DD\nFriend: you watched to much wolf of wallstreet\nPersona: bro this movie makes me move\nPersona: also generally this event had cool people\nPersona: also sometimes I talk to some person, I find them only midly interesting and then it becomes hard to lose them, so I'been thinking of ways how to excuse myself without appearing rude\nPersona: and going for a vape outside is good\nPersona: then when I reenter I approach new person\nFriend: but you gotta do it extra tactical\nPersona: how?\nFriend: like tell them it was nice\nbut you'll go for a vape\nand maybe youll talk again\nFriend: or some shit like that \n\nthat doesn't necessarily mean you talk again\n\nbut also doesn't stop it abruptly to make them feel \"this guy more interested in vape than networking\"\nPersona: yeah true\nPersona: I should leave some hook\nPersona: technique #2 inspired by you: engage another person standing next to, and leave them together talking\nPersona: :DDD\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nPersona: yeah, I am trying to convince him that funneling pressurized air through straws will increase the GPU cooling effectiveness by 30%, resulting in faster model training speeds\nPersona: I think it makes total sense. Otherwise it would be strange\nPersona: Now you are too kind\nFriend: and that's without cheating? time to rethink career choices. your powers are getting wasted on the smart stuff\nFriend: apparently there's even a douchebag manual in case you need some extra guidance\nFriend: on top of that, this will stop him from talking for a moment. well played sir\nFriend: perhaps. they would be too powerful if they had people skills as well\nFriend: let's see if you'll still hold that view once the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate\nPersona: hey how are you? how do you feel with tommorows interview\nPersona: sorry had a terribly busy week and I am just terrible at chatting xd\nPersona: weirdly, but I learnt some/many of these things are if not neccesary then very effective at climbing the ladder\nPersona: Some are bad and ineffective, but I feel this guide can actually be effective ahaha\nPersona: like at work for example, you have to get noticed not only by your manager, but by manager's manager. You really have to make sure that your skill is noticed\nPersona: This guide really reminds me of Lithuanian older generation\nPersona: Also after reading this guide I realized I also had a wrong understanding of 'arrogant'\nPersona: With your help I will redefine my whole vocab\nPersona: I think this evening I had the most social experience in our anti-social kitchen\nPersona: 4 of us were holding an inclusive conversation for a considerable time\nPersona: Good luck today!\nPersona: How did it go?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: we go by car and we to to Ramen to Biru\nPersona: no, we have to pay xd\nPersona: I just want Ramen\nPersona: tough day\nFriend: Ok\nFriend: Im tdy\nFriend: Rdy\nFriend: But\nFriend: Im not sure i dhould spend food tiday\nPersona: come to Volunteer hub\nPersona: Date went smooth, but idk if I like her enough\nPersona: I really thought it will be harder to get her and that annoys me\nPersona: and I didnt expect her to be so shy in her manners, like I can see a clearn lack of confidence, atleast near me\nFriend: Man....\n XD i won't be able to understand fully why shy is bad for you\nI have different mindset\nPersona: got a danske bank acc\nPersona: we gotta talk about girls today\nFriend: Here?\nFriend: I have 30 Mik left\nFriend: Min\nPersona: Green tent\nPersona: whaaaaays up\nPersona: wya?\nFriend: Selling\nFriend: Tent\nFriend: Catering\nFriend: Sandwiches\nPersona: u still on shift?\nPersona: okay\nPersona: I will come\nPersona: there are many tents\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\nPersona: thats a CV\nPersona: You are hired!\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so there are some differences then that you found\nFriend: in this particular case it's not very telling because we didn't see any correlation with behaviour\nFriend: but read the first paragraph here\nPersona: like entrepreneurs show a higher dmpfc activation when it comes to getting rewards for oneself, while managers show higher activation when the rewards is not for them. If you had you translate this to a general business newspaper article headline, how would it sound?\nPersona: okay give me a sec\nFriend: this for example could indicate that higher activation is related to decision efficiency\nPersona: ok it kind of vaguely answers my question I think\nFriend: not really. it just indicates that ent and man may be affected differently by decision context\nFriend: but still so what if it doesn't have effect on behaviour\nPersona: Is dmpfc high/low somehow related to exploration/explotation?\nPersona: exploitation*\nPersona: Even if there are no behavioral differences. if the brain activations are different that might show something about the difference between man and ent. Especially if I could know what those activations mean generally. Like if higher dmpfc activation is also present when eating ice cream during winter, then that might tell me that entrepreneurs taking risk has something in common with eating ice cream during winter\nPersona: the example is stupid\nPersona: but\nPersona: I hope you get the pount\nFriend: not to my knowledge. we investigated that region bc it has been shown previously that it may be involved in differentiation between decisions made for self and others (see 1st paragraph below). that's actually a useful result of our study bc it adds evidence to that hypothesis\nFriend: in a perfect world yes, but in reality it is possible that this effect is due to chance. fMRI is not a terribly reliable or replicable method, so take that with a rain of salt\nFriend: nothing is really this straightforward in neuroscience, but thats a long conversation\nPersona: google is being really helpful\nFriend: valence is just positive or negative\nPersona: ok so basically, I can't really raise the findings of your thesis above the neuroscience sea level, and it mostly concerns other neuroscience research. It can't show something to someone not in neuroscience yet.\nPersona: would that be right?\nFriend: I think that's a good way to look at it. it's useful for the sake of perfecting the methodology (both in terms of what to do and what not to do), but we haven't really come any closer to understanding what differentiates entrepreneurs from the gen. population\nPersona: okay, fair enough\nPersona: ty for the patience haha\nFriend: not gonna lie, choosing the post nye hangover day for discussing science is quite cruel of you \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: but you're very welcome\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Im free on monday,  you got work then?\nPersona: we can meet aftet\nPersona: I think we will finish with vinterbadning at 14\nFriend: Perfect!\nFriend: Where do you want to meet?\nFriend: Btw pls remember to take my stuff\nPersona: yeah I took it\nPersona: hmmm its raining lol\nPersona: maybe next house\nFriend: oki\nPersona: ok im already done\nPersona: what are you doing now?\nFriend: Literally nothing\nFriend: Needed to chill\nPersona: wya?\nPersona: I am already at next house\nFriend: Next house\nFriend: Wow ok\nFriend: Give me 5-10min\nFriend: Ill go downstairs\nFriend: Aphrodite \ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f cleared your nickname.\nPersona: How was the escape room?\nPersona: sorry if I was rude this weekend, was very anxious about the exam and the masters applications and also just tired\nPersona: You are welcome to be my guest on your next trip!\nPersona: you can also come over for tonight if you want\nFriend: Escape room was great! A bit difficult so we needed hints, but finished in time. Ive been to ERs multiple times but they had riddles that ive never seen, so it was engaging\nFriend: Thanks, but I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that\nPersona: why?\nFriend: Don\u2019t want to create any awkward situations. We can meet up but I don\u2019t feel like staying over\nPersona: Okay I underatand, but pls dont shame me for these awkward situations\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What date is it ?\nPersona: saturday\nPersona: Come to our party\nPersona: its happening in an hour\nPersona: bring dana\nPersona: You called Denis.\nFriend: You missed a call from Denis.\nFriend: U have my adress ?\nFriend: I can join for few hours\nPersona: The video chat ended.\nPersona: send address\nFriend: Bispeparken 42\nPersona: here\nPersona: like last time\nPersona: You called Denis.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: You called Denis.\nPersona: u got in?\nFriend: Clozing\nFriend: What kitchen ?\nFriend: Can u open ?\nFriend: For us ?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: bri\nPersona: u good\nPersona: where r u?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: Hey man, how are you?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: data couch on character ai?\nFriend: Date\nFriend: Ella\nPersona: ohhh\nPersona: I misread data\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: Kota - daylight\nFriend: Listen to 0:40 to 0:45\nPersona: :DDDDD\nPersona: Why would one ask this even in the altenative meaning? \"I wonder if my dad hangs out with me?\"\nPersona: Or it means \"get along with?\"\nPersona: still you don't need to wonder, you know that :D\nFriend: yeah get along with more\nnot hang out with\nFriend: getting along is a good alternative for fuck with\nFriend: get along good\nPersona: Alright\nPersona: I would not use it with someone unless they know the meaning of it\nFriend: but i think it's not easy to know sometimes \n\nlike we hang out less time f.ex. but at some point maybe you think I start being too much gme conspiracy and not interesting for you to be friends with\n\nbut you would'nt say it outright so we just meet less and less and you avoid going out f.ex. with me\n\nbut because it hasnt been said out loud I can't know if there is something wrong and if you get along with me still\nFriend: yeah :D\nPersona: hm, in that hypothetical situation yeah, I agree question makes sense\nFriend: bruuh\nbe happy your boss is not writing you\nFriend: mine started writing me\nFriend: and he is super micro managing\nFriend: I found out there is even a coined term for it from the colleagues\n\nthe famous \"non confrontational discussion\"\nFriend: 1 hour we argue when do i work\nPersona: damn\nPersona: Xdd\nPersona: it happened to me too\nPersona: For two yeara I am recording each minute of my work on google sheets\nPersona: for each task\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Sleep deprived driving is no\nFriend: Sleep in car if tired and then continue is my strategy\nPersona: sleep in car while continuing\nPersona: that my personal strategy\nPersona: hows the IT thing?\nFriend: Good so far\nLearning new stuff\nWill try to make good impression get a job\nPersona: did you watch that?\nPersona: send some pics\nFriend: Lol ye just finished\nFriend: Cant arrange by dick\nPersona: XXDDDDDDXDD\nPersona: this is gold\nPersona: there is version 2\nPersona: with excel and virus\nPersona: the 2nd is from sales guyPOV\nPersona: and ita soooooo goooe\nFriend: i wanna do uber\nPersona: nice video\nPersona: funny\nPersona: you whats on the vid is everyday stuff?\nPersona: think*\nFriend: probably not\nFriend: but idk\nPersona: this guys is so chsrismstic though.

I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which the others didn\u2019t have\nFriend: so we should maybe be ready to answer something more abt that\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: We have some work to do today\nPersona: excuse me, whos Savanna? \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: I\u2019m dumb and I literally came up with the name too ahhaha\nPersona: I found empty room SP212\nFriend: You\u2019re not there anymore are you ?\nFriend: majority of questions were about the paper and she asked us some super paper-specific questions but also about our design-thinking, customer personas and how we developed them, then alternative launch strategies (and here she wanted super specific names like even when describing how micromarket strategy would apply to our case we didnt say the specific name and used \"niche market\" instead so she wanted to know what is the actual CORRECT strategy name) and then at the end she gave us both a few questions on other theories from the course which she assigned directly to a person. in that part we had multiple questions about servitization so what it is, how it changes the customer relationship with the company and value and etc. it is 95% christiane asking the questions i think the external dude asked us only 1 question that was related to developing a platform since it's his area of expertise or smth. during the exam i thought everything was chill tho cuz we answered correctly to all the questions that she asked us even with theories and stuff but when she gave grade feedback she then thought that we \"didnt hit certain keywords\" she wanted to hear so in our case atleast it  felt that she was excessively critical\nPersona: Which campus are we meeting on?\nFriend: The exam is at Dalgas so I would prefer to meet there\nFriend: Me 2\nPersona: might be hard to practice speech there tho\nFriend: We should be able to find somewhere\nFriend: Previously I\u2019ve been able to find spare rooms there\nFriend: Its one of the last days of exams too\nPersona: okay\nFriend: I think it\u2019s very weird that she hints at theories and wants us to name them\nFriend: Like the 4 letter nice one etc.\nFriend: That is very strange imo\nPersona: yeah, would better see if we underatand then and not if we know the labels\nFriend: She kinda puts you on the spot\nFriend: Because it\u2019s hard to remember a name of a theory in the first place but only saying it includes bubbles makes it harder\nPersona: :DDD yeah bubles wtf, anything could be put into boubles\nPersona: But anyways, lets rock the theory tonight\nFriend: that a fucked way to ask\nFriend: bro\nFriend: i am decreased\nFriend: Damn I\u2019m a bit stressed rn\nFriend: A bit worried\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get.

So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I judge courses too much by the crowd\nPersona: like ITU really turned me off for some reason, althought I talked to very few. I visually judged lol. Thats bad\nPersona: this is CBS people\nPersona: fucking gorgeous, but evolutionary unfit\nFriend: ah yeah. maybe \na little more than 6 I think\n\ncause I didn't have full su first education\nFriend: I affirm\nFriend: but .. idk\n\nthere is a lot of that in life too\nPersona: of what?\nPersona: visual judging?\nPersona: or juding by crowd?\nFriend: both\n\nthink it's efficient to stick around ppl with looks\nFriend: just like in stock market because you assume market is efficient and someone else did the math, best to invest in whats going up\nFriend: xd idk that didnt make sense\nPersona: It made sense after I read it twice\nPersona: but it may not be because somebody did the math\nPersona: price went up. Somebody thought somebody did the math\nPersona: but nobody did the math\nFriend: exactly\nPersona: but so many people baught that the buying changed the math itself, so now the math is suddently good anyways\nPersona: time to write that personal statement. Fuck I hope I can go to sleep soon\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end.

I saw some cheap one at fotex, but maybe we get tickets first, I am not sure\nPersona: Or maybe its worth getting a tent anyways\nFriend: I think my roommates got tents that I could borrow\nFriend: I will find out asap\nPersona: whats your plan today?\nPersona: You want to meet a little bit earlier?\nFriend: Yo I am open to whatever, what do you think?\nFriend: Tomorrow will be kinda fucked on weather though from early morning, I don't think it makes sense to stay the night\nPersona: Yeah I know about the shit weather, thats why I think more people will leaving today. But if we get in for free, we got nothing to lose\nPersona: I think I will take a shower now and then I am down to meet, we can go to roskilde anytime\nFriend: I feel like the rain would ruin it for me, it's a bit too much commitment with all the dirt, cold and wetness\nPersona: the festival ends Sunday\nPersona: congrats on the new client\nPersona: if its important, just focus and work on it\nPersona: there will be plenty of times to party\nPersona: Roskilde is ending on Sunday and there is nothing that day playing.\nFriend: Thank you my G it's a big deal for me and it's pretty stressful\nPersona: I am down just going there for the night, I have at least 5 good friends who are now at Roskilde, so joining their camp the is the option. No camping. Just staying and partying during the night, until it gets too rough, then train back to cph\nPersona: But probably not going to that alone, Yash is bailing out idk why, he was the guy wanting it since the beginning haha\nPersona: So if its too wild for you tonight, which is totally understandable, since you got real business todo, I am down for a more chill night out too.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: chest\nPersona: could be\nPersona: I think it could be sweat\nPersona: I heard this before\nPersona: sweat is attractive\nPersona: I also kinda like women sweat lol\nPersona: oh dear\nPersona: nice, is it now?\nFriend: yeah i think so\nPersona: nice\nPersona: maybe next weeknd we could take some nice photos\nFriend: yee\nnext weekend Zoe bday tho\nPersona: lets see as the time goes\nFriend: you wanna do during week or no?\nPersona: I need to give back sword and shield to zoe\nPersona: idk if I am capable\nPersona: I need extra hours in a day\nFriend: yeah..\nFriend: day kinda short\nbut so nice weather\nFriend: gotta go chill on the beaches\nPersona: weather niceee\nPersona: but this weekend I have startuo weekend\nPersona: its like hackathon for startups\nFriend: nice tho\ngj being productive\nPersona: yeah its easy when you sign up for stuff\nPersona: you force yourself\nPersona: but my team is barely satisfactory. I kimda fucked up with team choice\nPersona: But its interesting in terms of team competencies\nPersona: 2 technical ppl. 2 cbs business people\nPersona: and me\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we go directly to the event\nPersona: I will ask him now\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: idk what do you think?\nPersona: I am.50/50\nPersona: If I go there I know I would have a fun time but I also know thats sub-optimal at this point in time, due to the task heaviness of my week.\nPersona: So I would be happy to go and happy not to go.\nPersona: I am in perfect serenity regarding this decision\nFriend: Ive been becoming overwhelmed with tasks\nFriend: Specially because i slack\nSelf feeding negative loop\n\nSo im down to not go but if i not go i ha e to spend quality time\nEither work on problem or good relax\nFriend: So better to go if im gonna waste my time and be bad\nPersona: If you are 50/50, then its while(True): pass\nPersona: we need a break\nFriend: Ye.. chill time\n\nPortugal girl hasnt written me about it either..  so maybe pass\nFriend: Im gonna try to focus being in the living room maybe\n\nUse it as motivation to work \nCause.my room is baghdad\nFriend: With shelves and picture on wall and plant\n\nMaybe gonna be very good place to study together\nPersona: Okay no go to comedy then, but hm hm maybe its to good idea to come to study at you place\nPersona: I have so much to catch up idk where to start\nFriend: soo \nword of bad advice \ndon't start anywhere if you don't know and play video games instead\nFriend: but I told myself this morning \"no more\" and will try to do focused work \na little bit of all\nFriend: but one thing at a time\nFriend: maybe it's not optimal at first but better than overwhelmed\n\nand then end of day would be good to do a review, if the time put in things is well split or one thing needs more time than another\nFriend: so you say fuck all but this one thing.\nI care about this one thing only in the next 3 hours\nFriend: think I'm pumping myself up here xD not you\nFriend: I need some advice for myself\nFriend: girls are gonna kill me \ud83d\ude05 \nI don't have it either\nPersona: btw, are you at CBS now?\nFriend: at work\nPersona: Go to CBS library, that helps\nPersona: Yeah, if that included breaks every 25 or 50 mins, then this is nice\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I biked 30 min home\nPersona: 2 hours before each rimworld game is modding\nPersona: And I love this modding community\nPersona: I am currently running ~100 mods\nPersona: and its lighly modded in a way\nPersona: most of the mods are quality of life\nPersona: 1 mod is a complete overhaul, maybe 10 - 15 major content mods\nPersona: and another 10 - 20 minor content mods\nPersona: rest quality of life\nPersona: I don't even know whats vanilla tbh\nPersona: I have to use an external Rimworld mod manager with python\nFriend: :DD\nPersona: Rimworld is so nice\nPersona: So additing\nPersona: I dont need life goals. I can have goals in rimworld and live with that\nPersona: I had a pretty good gamd yesterday. I been trying to play naked brutality with almost harderst difficulty, hardcire combat overhaul mod and perdeath\nPersona: I got pretty far, mode than usual. Usually, I survive around a year and my colony dies, but always in some different ways\nPersona: Hey mate, patryk, antoni and I are going to try cs2 today\nPersona: do you want to join?\nFriend: Yess\nFriend: Getting it now\nPersona: \ud83e\udd29\nFriend: a bit slow tho\nPersona: same\nPersona: I started 18o clock is still going\nPersona: its*\nPersona: how much left?\nFriend: 50\nPersona: wanna hop on dc?\nFriend: WomboCombo#4163\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: In foetex atm\nFriend: Home\nFriend: Shower and stuff\nReaddy if you qant to come in 30+\nPersona: okay\nPersona: need to get over my laziness\nFriend: Take your time\nI have postknight 2 on phone xD\nGood game\nPersona: Yo man, I realized I am.not just lazy I havent slept much\nPersona: maybe lets do it tommorow\nPersona: I will.nap\nFriend: Ah alright\nFriend: Take care\nFriend: I'll catch you tomorrow maybe then\nPersona: bruh real life is intruding into my nolife at this point\nPersona: this polish chich I dated/slept at in Poland now wants to play pc games with me\nFriend: Big win\nPersona: idk man, i wonder how will she enjoy rimworld\nFriend: Good test\nFriend: Maybe she does\nPersona: do you know about banano?\nPersona: Spent half say trying to fix corrupted windows only to give up and do a reinnstall\nPersona: I also backuped whole appdata folder just because\nPersona: it took a while even with robocopy. Maybe that will avoid me making some settings in apps\nPersona: I am.more and more convincing myself to build a powerful gaming pc. But thats equivalent to 1.5 - 2 trips abroad\nFriend: NOT A SHITCOIN (UNTIL DIGESTED)\n\nI like it already\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: Saw this on my phone and thought you got scared of spilling water\nPersona: xddd\nPersona: No no, I managed to get my windows broken\nPersona: software issue only\nPersona: (I think)"

What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: ok so basically, I can't really raise the findings of your thesis above the neuroscience sea level, and it mostly concerns other neuroscience research. It can't show something to someone not in neuroscience yet.\nPersona: would that be right?\nFriend: I think that's a good way to look at it. it's useful for the sake of perfecting the methodology (both in terms of what to do and what not to do), but we haven't really come any closer to understanding what differentiates entrepreneurs from the gen. population\nPersona: okay, fair enough\nPersona: ty for the patience haha\nFriend: not gonna lie, choosing the post nye hangover day for discussing science is quite cruel of you \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: but you're very welcome\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\nFriend: we were just having drinks and playing board games until 6 in the morning\nFriend: how was yours?\nPersona: the fireworks weren't that good here haha, I was also home\nPersona: I had literallly the most chill too\nPersona: I felt a bit sick so stayed home, talked with friends on discord\nPersona: So I am alive and healthy today, apart from having an inverse daynight cycle for the past wekk\nFriend: oh god, I'm so sick of those. it felt like going through a war zone when I was biking to the dorm from home\nFriend: aw shame I didn't know. you could've joined us\nFriend: glad it's nothing serious. you're coming back to school already or you're having a longer Christmas break?\nPersona: isn't the bass you feel in your chest after an explosion kind of thrilling to you?\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which the others didn\u2019t have\nFriend: so we should maybe be ready to answer something more abt that\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: We have some work to do today\nPersona: excuse me, whos Savanna? \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: I\u2019m dumb and I literally came up with the name too ahhaha\nPersona: I found empty room SP212\nFriend: You\u2019re not there anymore are you ?\nFriend: majority of questions were about the paper and she asked us some super paper-specific questions but also about our design-thinking, customer personas and how we developed them, then alternative launch strategies (and here she wanted super specific names like even when describing how micromarket strategy would apply to our case we didnt say the specific name and used \"niche market\" instead so she wanted to know what is the actual CORRECT strategy name) and then at the end she gave us both a few questions on other theories from the course which she assigned directly to a person. in that part we had multiple questions about servitization so what it is, how it changes the customer relationship with the company and value and etc. it is 95% christiane asking the questions i think the external dude asked us only 1 question that was related to developing a platform since it's his area of expertise or smth. during the exam i thought everything was chill tho cuz we answered correctly to all the questions that she asked us even with theories and stuff but when she gave grade feedback she then thought that we \"didnt hit certain keywords\" she wanted to hear so in our case atleast it  felt that she was excessively critical\nPersona: Which campus are we meeting on?\nFriend: The exam is at Dalgas so I would prefer to meet there\nFriend: Me 2\nPersona: might be hard to practice speech there tho\nFriend: We should be able to find somewhere\nFriend: Previously I\u2019ve been able to find spare rooms there\nFriend: Its one of the last days of exams too\nPersona: okay\nFriend: I think it\u2019s very weird that she hints at theories and wants us to name them\nFriend: Like the 4 letter nice one etc.\nFriend: That is very strange imo\nPersona: yeah, would better see if we underatand then and not if we know the labels\nFriend: She kinda puts you on the spot\nFriend: Because it\u2019s hard to remember a name of a theory in the first place but only saying it includes bubbles makes it harder\nPersona: :DDD yeah bubles wtf, anything could be put into boubles\nPersona: But anyways, lets rock the theory tonight\nFriend: that a fucked way to ask\nFriend: bro\nFriend: i am decreased\nFriend: Damn I\u2019m a bit stressed rn\nFriend: A bit worried\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so I just took this shortcut\nFriend: Ye\nPersona: instead of trying to find where is  the genesis of the pre tag\nFriend: Here is the risky part:\nYoure targeting an html tag\nSo higher chance to affect other stuff that use it\n\nOn the good side its not a very used one\nFriend: Have some way to mark these rules as hacks\nWith comment or something. Explain why if you think it might be removed by future you\nFriend: And create a big backlog of tiny things that need fixing\nFriend: Once a month or less you can check the big bad log for any cleanup tasks that are necessary or easy\nFriend: That's at least my strat\nPersona: nice strat\nPersona: Where do you keep the backlog of non-urgent fixes, that are now working because of hack?\nPersona: in team notion, somwhere in github?\nPersona: or you query the codebase somehow for flagged comments?\nFriend: On old job we used youtrack for issue tracking\n\nSo youd make an issue\nGet the number and slap it in a comment in the code\n\nAdd description to the issue in the issue tracker\n\nMaybe something in the comment in code if necessary\nPersona: ah okay\nPersona: We don't have it I think but I came make a page for it on team Notion\nFriend: Make a space in your issue tracker in a way\nSo you can filter those issues out\nFriend: Like a tag \n\nOr low priority\nPersona: Yeah\nPersona: Nice\nPersona: Lol I am literally alone working on the websites and issue backlog was stacked up so huge from before\nPersona: But its fun\nPersona: I am like shooting at target eliminating enemies\nPersona: completing missions\nFriend: \ud83d\ude02 nice\nFriend: two tickets for tomorrow\nPersona: Nice thanks\nFriend: where do you donate money to ukr btw?\nPersona: I did through many single time campaigns\nPersona: but anytime if I do then here\nPersona: But that mainly for LT, although I think they allow international too\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\nFriend: nooo\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\nFriend: I love that clip\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\nFriend: other than Venus\nFriend: because that would suck\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\nPersona: you have good ideas\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yo, anything planned for haloween?\nFriend: I don't even know when it is\nI'm too swamped with studies\nPersona: end of month\nFriend: That sounds new\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: I haven't heard you have no fomo on friday :D\nFriend: Did you have a good time coding\nPersona: No, I had 50 null safery errors after I opened my old Flutter project\nPersona: jk xdd\nPersona: (not jk)\nPersona: but chill time\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: Man\n\nI get in cbs, and we having a party\nLan party or dance out\nOr code day\nFriend: Or repair a bike tire\nFriend: But good\nFriend: Or sauna\nPersona: You did?\nPersona: Saunaaaaa\nPersona: nice\nPersona: Xddd\nPersona: I sourced I new bike, but that also needs repair, but simplier lol\nPersona: Lan party nice\nPersona: Code day nice\nFriend: Oh bike ride day\nFriend: Butif it happens winter timr\nFriend: Are you ok with drifting or bad weather biking\nFriend: it's 2023\nwoman doesn't want to clean at home anymore\nPersona: I never tried drifting, alsp idk if my car would be good for that xd\nPersona: Bad weather biking idk, depends how I fix my bike\nPersona: XDDDSSDD\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: MVC\n\nModel view controller\n\nBackend \nFrontend\nBackend\n\nXD \nIm confused if they look for a fullstacker and not a frontender\nFriend: But they do put some really hardcore frontend stuff like A11y, SSR  \nAnd then they ask a bunch of backend shit or cms stuff\nFriend: Wtf is happening outside atm\nPersona: bro I drove with car this morning at 8\nPersona: crazy\nPersona: Sllid once a bit just to test the waters\nFriend: Wowow\nFriend: Nice?\nPersona: was a bit scary at firat\nPersona: firat\nPersona: first\nPersona: especially since the breaks were a bit sus\nPersona: but then I think it was the ABS kicking in\nFriend: Yeah abs annoying for drift\nThats why you use handbreak xD\nPersona: Idk, but it protect me from unintentional drift xd\nFriend: Abs good\nI tested abs on thebike tosay\nPersona: do you even need pedal brake for drift?\nPersona: it exists?\nFriend: Lot of snow in the backalley and when i go fast i pretend to break with abs\nPersona: xdddddd\nFriend: Yeah just push break til wheel locks, release\nAnd do that fast\nFriend: Pedal breaks\nPersona: yeah nice\nFriend: Basically put pressure/weight on the leg pressing and release\nBit like jumping on one leg\nFriend: Not great for drift but good stability\nPersona: oh you break witg legs\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: forgot\nPersona: but bike is not that damgerous antways.

Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually.

I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good.

But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them?

Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Ah fuck you are right\nPersona: I just Googled it\nFriend: hahaha\nFriend: yeha\nPersona: You may have saved my liver in the long run, thanks <3\nFriend: its scary\nPersona: but now its up to me to change it\nPersona: but wtf, why we can't have nice things\nPersona: Energy drinks literally makes me happy\nFriend: but i mean i drink a fuck ton of coke so i am not that mich better myself\nFriend: hahahah\nPersona: is it sugarfree?\nFriend: youre very welcome\nFriend: depends on my mood\nFriend: i mean i have learned that sugar free is actually better than the zer sugar ones\nPersona: so when do you drink with sugar and when without haha?\nPersona: Vic\nPersona: I think your brain crashed\nFriend: sugar is for when i either feel a headache coming or if a need extra gas for my brain\nFriend: ahhaha oh i see\nFriend: i meant the other way\nPersona: You said sugar free is better than zero sugar\nFriend: sugar is better than sugar free\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: lord jesus i need to do smomthing else that sit by my damn computer\nPersona: But that depends on your goals\nPersona: Cause like sugary drinks give acne, but maybe the sugarfree ones are worse for teeth idk\nPersona: Should we get back to lovely do?\nFriend: no bc there is some chemical in the sugar free onces that is seriously bad for u and accumulates in your body bc its really hard to get rid off\nFriend: haha yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yup, eventually you surprass that. I don't know how to make ideas come better though\nFriend: how are u awake?\nPersona: yeah but its mostly because of the damned DO. If not DO I would be much healthier\nFriend: and fucntioning\nFriend: hahaha\nFriend: A few weeks ago i was taking care of my horse bc he was sick so for 3 days straight both night and day I had to check on him and do some medical stuff every 2 hours without breaks\nPersona: I may have addiciton to energy drinks\nFriend: i ahve never felt more tourtured in my life and now whenever i feel sorry for myself i remind myself that i am showing pussy behavior compared to that\nPersona: :OO\nPersona: Thats crazy\nPersona: thats so disrupting wtf\nPersona: can't someone else paid do that?\nFriend: jesus airi and u laugh at my coke addiction\nPersona: I think it sounds worse than it is. Its like maybe one a day on average. And they are sugar free so its not worse than coffee I think\nFriend: u know when you have been sick in your liver the doctors will allow you to drink alcohol before they allow you to drink energy drinks.....\nFriend: thats pretty disturbing\nPersona: Reallly?\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: Fuck, okay I gotta rethink\nFriend: my sister was really sick one with her liver and literally even 2 years after the doctors still advised her not to drink it\nPersona: Ah fuck you are right\nPersona: I just Googled it\nFriend: hahaha\nFriend: yeha\nPersona: You may have saved my liver in the long run, thanks <3\nFriend: its scary\nPersona: but now its up to me to change it\nPersona: but wtf, why we can't have nice things\nPersona: Energy drinks literally makes me happy\nFriend: but i mean i drink a fuck ton of coke so i am not that mich better myself\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah I think divinity, power, confidence arouses me\nPersona: but divinity would be a kink (if there is one) that is like never achievable. Same with anime porn (forgot how its called)\nPersona: hentai!\nPersona: would have to wait 100 years until they make a full dive simulation experience and satisfy my divine needs\nPersona: Greek times must have been fun, they believed they were real, they had a dream. I am sure they jerked off to the marble sculptures\nPersona: Look at this mood\nPersona: the view through window is picturesque\nFriend: Daamn\nFriend: I see the beauty now of seeing far\nFriend: Im not complaining but prefer yours atm\nPersona: nice wallpaper xd\nPersona: My dream view is to live high up and have a view on an open busy street. That gives me this hard to describle economic feeling\nPersona: The feeling that economic action is happening, supply and demand is meeting, decimal points are changing\nPersona: Locality? whats tht\nFriend: daamn\nFriend: i guess hq\nPersona: :DDDD\nPersona: :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\nPersona: nice\nPersona: I was using ChatGPT for help with flutter and it understood most of the questions really well until I got to this. It gave me a properpy reference of a default Flutter libary object that does not exist. I searched in google for any references to this property, but nobody ever mentioned it.\nPersona: Then when I asked him if he was sure, he responded with this xdddd\nPersona: \"I don't have an apple, but instead I have an apple\"\nFriend: Wth\nFriend: Well i hope it works good cause tomorrow i got exam\nPersona: :Ddd\nPersona: Good luck\nPersona: this is perfect\nPersona: my slave OpenAI\nFriend: god damn\nFriend: those are some good question followings to get a linkedin response\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Every firearm delivered to ukraine is free attack damage to NATO and Lithuanias biggest threat while also supporting ukraine. So for me fight support is win-win.\nPersona: There is also 1K fund in lithuania that's popular\nPersona: But they donate for similar stuff than blye-yellow\nFriend: what a logo\nPersona: yah xdd\nPersona: I think I should donate today aswell haha\nPersona: I'll do 1k fund, never done through that actually\nPersona: you can donate with revolut I see\nPersona: (of course you can cause Revolut a Lithuanian bank xdd)\nFriend: hate corporations \nhate everything today\nFriend: all companies gay logo\nFriend: where is ukraine logo_\nPersona: Xdddd\nPersona: go to russia or saudi arabia lol\nPersona: they dont have\nFriend: yeah and they have black\nFriend: i have seen\nFriend: fuck all\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: lol\nPersona: I wonder did Lt companies do gay logo. Cause not most lt companies have Ukraine logo\nPersona: Ukraine freedom > gay\nPersona: now*\nFriend: if you see a company doing ukraine logo, pm me\nPersona: In lithuania its like every 3rd company\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo. All LT companies\nPersona: even most lithuanian company\nPersona: most of these biggest companies here probably have it.\nFriend: LT doing good\nDenmark too far from Russia to care\nPersona: Using windows and mac at the same time is so confusing god damn. My hands are starting to mess up at keyboard shortcuts.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but I do stand corrected. it may be kind of possible\nFriend: the technique is actually legit. recently used for mood improvement. pretty cool\nFriend: the lucid dream part is more tricky. seems that til now only 1 study from 2012 succesfully captured the difference between REM and lucid-REM. and they recruited 4 experienced lucid dreamers, and still only 1 had a lucid dream in the scanner lol + the activated network is pretty dispersed\nFriend: skimmed through a recent meta analysis. most attempts to induce lucid dreams failed. only in one with transcranial stimulation they had a mild effect, but only in experienced lucid dreamers. interestingly galantimine (AD medication) induced lucid dreams in 42% inexperienced people vs 17% in placebo group\nFriend: but feasibility aside, it seems a bit risky. we don't even fully understand what REM and dreams are for, but we do know that deficiency in REM is associated with increased death rate, so it's not sth I would really fuck with for funsies\nFriend: *oops galantamine and 14%, not 17%\nFriend: yup, soft d is a beauty. can kind of hear it, but no clue how to produce it\nFriend: I've seen quite a lot. strangely enough, not Breaking Bad. would say Peaky Blinders, Hannibal and Mr Robot are my top 3. fairly recently I've watched Succession and also loved it\nFriend: woah why is this so specific? are you referencing something?\ud83d\ude33\nPersona: which vid are you reffering to, the academia pyramid one?\nPersona: Lucid dreaming? You can do it often?\nPersona: damn you went to the rabbit hole\nPersona: I merely skimmed, the article and sent it, cause I thought it would interest you, and here we go, Joanna at 2 AM haha\nPersona: be careful not to miss your REM sleep, I swear, someone just literally told me it can lead to increased death rate\nPersona: Peaky Blinders were always on my watch it, but I never watched it\nPersona: its meta programming. I think among the top expensive programming errors included a mid-air space rocket explosion. If I remember it correctly it was because someone mixed up imperial and metric units \ud83d\udc40\nPersona: but I invented the part with strongly typed language, but I am sure typos have also lead to some other expensive errors\nPersona: Actually, I just watched a movie and thought about lucid dreaming. Its really cool that a brain can simulate a world in you mind with actual senses and when one can guide what happens in the world, its even better\nPersona: I only lucid dream a few times, but I noticed, that yes, I can control what happens in the dream, but I can't invent new real knowledge, it's simply just physically impossible. If I try to travel to a place I never been or experience something I never did, the parts of that experience that I have experienced in real life will be simulated, but parts that I never will sort of a try to be substituted, combined, imagines with existing experiences that I have had. It really sort of reminds me how AI and neural networks work\nPersona: And I thought about it right now, because having 1 life in the present is god damn limiting. I am sometimes fascinated by different cultures, like I always wondered what it would be like to be true punk ahahah, life fuck education, career and just live a punk life, One can't really 'try it out', you have to give it a lot of life. And then I even went into the extremes of being curious what a life experience of a skinhead in 60s - 90s would be like. I am just curious to experience it without consequences to the real world\nPersona: Actually I have this theory, that the almost a century developed digital graphics and the more recent digital VR technology curve will be disrupted by dreaming based experiences. Brain can simulate a full dive virtual reality natively, while we are currently struggling with expensive and barely realistic haptic suits, limited field of view, etc.\nPersona: ugh I have this course now called Research Methods and its basically a course about academia. I don't think I am made for this haha \ud83d\ude2b\nFriend: nej, in the article you linked there's an X post from that company, and it contains a 10 min vid where the CEO explains what the deal is\nFriend: nono, that ultrasound brain stimulation technique\nFriend: seems like lucid dreaming could have some potential for PTSD treatment though, I've noticed quite a few articles about it, but haven't read. for this reason it would be really cool for a device like this to exist, but I think the aim here is commercial use, which I'm not the fan of\nFriend: I've been thinking about it a lot for the past few days actually haha\nFriend: you know what, I think you'd like it. I also need to rewatch it sometime because I haven't seen the last season and I don't remember what happened by that  point, but I just need to commit to waste of 40h of my life I'm never going to get back. haven't come to terms with it yet\nFriend: ah okay yes, it does ring a bell\nFriend: what movie?\nFriend: oh I'm so with you on this one. thogh it's sad because even lucid dreaming wouldn't give you that experience. you'd only sense your own idea of what a life like this would look like\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic"

Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end.

I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them.

I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So random, I will catch up on the rest of convo later (I got 2%)\nPersona: then you would be in danger of curing depression by drowing.

When I am making coffee at work and choose between all the inclusive selection of milks, I must not take the lactose free one. I want my lactose. I always make sure I take one with lactose and I announce it verbally\nPersona: I just noticed the message didnt sent and my phone died yesterday \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I would not do this at 10 in the morning \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: atleast not so intensely animated\nFriend: excellent choice \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: oh no, bathtub is your idea. that's a you problem \ud83d\ude44\nFriend: my only battle is trying not to choke on beer\nFriend: speaking of Poland.

You must look deadly funny drinking piwko lying flat on the ground. A true piwko akrobat\nPersona: recipe for your ritual*\nPersona: my best polish friend is leaving denmark for a long while or maybe forever today. The universe sends me a replacement. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be\nPersona: what is the correct meaning of narcissism then?\nPersona: and how do people use it wrong?\nPersona: force them to submission. milk tolerance dominance. everytime\nFriend: this is an extreme sport. when I was little my mum always told me not to drink while lying down bc apparently there is a story of a girl who did that once, choked and went into coma\nFriend: I'm so mad. I was waiting 2 years for fsb to give me my own polish person in the kitchen \ud83d\ude20\nFriend: idk people just tend to diagnose every person who wronged them with a mental illness\nPersona: my finding at 2 am today\nPersona: unrelated to anything\nPersona: (the video is the same, it just showed that it couldn't send, so I sent it again)\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all.

Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: MVC\n\nModel view controller\n\nBackend \nFrontend\nBackend\n\nXD \nIm confused if they look for a fullstacker and not a frontender\nFriend: But they do put some really hardcore frontend stuff like A11y, SSR  \nAnd then they ask a bunch of backend shit or cms stuff\nFriend: Wtf is happening outside atm\nPersona: bro I drove with car this morning at 8\nPersona: crazy\nPersona: Sllid once a bit just to test the waters\nFriend: Wowow\nFriend: Nice?\nPersona: was a bit scary at firat\nPersona: firat\nPersona: first\nPersona: especially since the breaks were a bit sus\nPersona: but then I think it was the ABS kicking in\nFriend: Yeah abs annoying for drift\nThats why you use handbreak xD\nPersona: Idk, but it protect me from unintentional drift xd\nFriend: Abs good\nI tested abs on thebike tosay\nPersona: do you even need pedal brake for drift?\nPersona: it exists?\nFriend: Lot of snow in the backalley and when i go fast i pretend to break with abs\nPersona: xdddddd\nFriend: Yeah just push break til wheel locks, release\nAnd do that fast\nFriend: Pedal breaks\nPersona: yeah nice\nFriend: Basically put pressure/weight on the leg pressing and release\nBit like jumping on one leg\nFriend: Not great for drift but good stability\nPersona: oh you break witg legs\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: forgot\nPersona: but bike is not that damgerous antways.

Hard to find a decent one lower than 800kr\nPersona: I am starting to think about giving repair a retry. But the more I wait, the more I spend on bus.\nPersona: ahhhh, I spend more energy thinking about it than it would cost money equivalent (perhaps)\nPersona: Idk if DYI is always a good strat\nPersona: I like DYI cause I would learn stuff, but its something quite trivial to learn, idk will it be worth later in life.\nPersona: And I better focus on my top impact agenda\nFriend: nice moral dilemma you discovered there\n\nafraid of the addictive qualities but happy with the positive effects\nFriend: Just tried the coolest can opening mechanisn\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: why reply tho?\nPersona: how does it work?\nFriend: hahaha \nthat's the most retarded thing you must have seen xD\nI replied because I wrote something but I guess it didn't go through with the picture\nFriend: I think it's a good dilemma you have there\nFriend: imo if you can control yourself kind of, it's a good thing\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity.

Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods.

Concerts end at 3am so thats going to be a big outflux for sure, but maybe we can find smth before\nPersona: Yash, another friend of mine you met at Fight club is also down for thia\nPersona: Saturday can rain a lot, so I guess a tent would be good.

Looks wise she is not the hottest chick, but in terms of intelligence its a rare find.\nPersona: from my point of view\nFriend: social confirmation received\nPersona: well you should get more\nPersona: if you want to trust it more than yourself\nFriend: I'm having huge confirmation bias now because I see it the same way\nFriend: don't know a girl that I can get an opinion from that I can trust with taht\nPersona: Maybe because we see women in similar way. But ask someone else too if you need more thoughts\nPersona: hmmm. Maybe Luiza?\nFriend: need to be super careful with analyzing her answer because she is always positive :DD\nPersona: or idk maybe even go with the flow, keep looking for other girls. I mean if you need so much of opinions what do others think about it, then maybe you are just forcing yourself to like her. When you actually like/love a girl, it shows clearly.\nFriend: I wonder how her brother would think because he was very religious and has a pure take sometimes\n\nbut honestly don't really want to know. Feel like the only social approval I need is my parents xD\nPersona: Lol I do also seek approval from my dad secretely\nPersona: but he has old fashioned perception of woman\nPersona: holy shit yesterday I had crazy experience"

I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\nFriend: to help you get there?\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\nPersona: Need to fix that\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nFriend: exactly :D\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Can it run offline?\nFriend: trusted web activity i imagine (because they call them activities) is the website element you can add to apps\nFriend: yep!\nFriend: you can install and run offline without this too tho \n\nthis is to get an apk to put on the app store if you want\nPersona: I mean then why would it be not allowed?\nPersona: weird\nFriend: \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f maybe because its ez to make web stuff compared to native\nFriend: and he doesn't want to ruin it for the others that chose pain\nPersona: I heard Microsoft is rebuilding whole office in React native, so not allowing web technologies is pure stupid\nFriend: :o nice\nFriend: \"Microsoft Office leverages React Native in several experiences across the suite of Office apps including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint\"\nFriend: daamn excel too\nFriend: maybe you get a good excel now\nFriend: better than g sheets if lucky\nPersona: If they remove the error sound then maybe\nPersona: I've became so good at sheets and its ArrayFormula that I cant imagine building anything without it and excel does not have it yet\nPersona: I mean they should overall remove all errors \ud83d\udc4d\nPersona: :)\nPersona: This is a small detail, but the error message in excel is so annoying. First it comes up in this 2000s style dialogue box, flashes, and also does a terrible sound. Everytime I get it, I feels like I was just punched in the face\nPersona: Sheets erros message, fade in, are nice and round, minimalistix and have no sound. They are like \"Sorry, but this cant be done\". And Excel erros are you \"YOU ARE WRONG!!!!!! LEARN TO USE EXCEL YOU STUPID SHIT\"\nPersona: bro\nPersona: Am I stupid\nPersona: or this river dude\nPersona: is pure nuts\nPersona: see this:\nPersona: this dude sent me an article saying whats the difference between web apps and mobile apps\nPersona: the order got messed up a bit? this one is first\nPersona: idk actually if this clears out\nPersona: Ionic is js/html/css but I think its different than bubblewrap\nFriend: \ud83d\ude02\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: B or less*\nPersona: I checke my secondary school classmates that were big in sports, year all born between Sep - Dec\nPersona: Yeah*\nPersona: Not big in sports\nPersona: but just\nPersona: A social players\nPersona: And they were the oldest in classs\nPersona: I am march so I guess I am middle\nPersona: nice episode\nPersona: explains about why 2%\nFriend: a book is used and worn having a limited lifespan\n\ndude! That is planned obsolescence\nFriend: that is just a subscription\nPersona: car is a subscription then too?\nPersona: almost every phisical item has limited lifespan\nFriend: Yeah\nCar has high depreciation\nIt just.. it annoyed me to see this comparison because it reminded me of planned obsolescence \n\nIts purposefully making things less durable so that you need to buy replacements\nFriend: And my father saw that with cars\nSo he had this a bit older toyota avensis instead where its cheap and easy to service and you don't need to do it often\nFriend: With bmw now they just extort him for money xD \nAnd he finds alternative ways to order parts and fix with people not form bmw\nPersona: man, do you think when people invented paper and books they had planned obsolence in mind?\nPersona: Also I never fully used up a book\nPersona: Unless you read those books in extreeme conditions and you read the everyday, I dont think it will physically deteriote, especially before you had enough of it\nPersona: I actually never baught a book because some other book in my possesion has physically depreciated\nPersona: I think you are overthinking \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Modern cars may have some planned obselence, yeah. I dont think its as bad as in mobile phone industry\nFriend: no but they are bringing that as an argument of why we can share a book and not share an e-book \ud83d\ude20\n\nOf course it's hard to use up a book\n\nand the best argument is money that should go to the author\n\nauthor would be dead when book is dead probably\nFriend: im just annoyed\ncause publishers make a lot of money too\n\nand capitalism doesn't fare well with the idea of free knowledge\nPersona: \"author would be dead when book is dead\" xdddd\nPersona: lol\nPersona: Ugh I understand, sometimes I get those anoyances too.\nPersona: I feel the same about the industry prefering Excel\nPersona: I recently had to buy books\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so you would have to resort to melee combat, animal etc to fight for you I guess. Or build turrets\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute. If they unfreeeze for a while, say a raid penetrates your base or a unaticipated heatwave heats it up, you will get poluttion in your map and it could be a lot you will need hazmat gear to just survive and clean it up.\nPersona: you could send the pollutioj away via transport pods to your enemies tho\nPersona: that will make them real angry and they will send raids to you\nPersona: there are also sangophuages - pretty much vampires that can live forever but have to drink blood - can be harvested regularly from prisoners\nPersona: There is also luciferium, a drug I never dares to take. It makea you instantly addicted to it and then if you dont consume it regularly, you will die. However it could overtime heal up otherwise unhealable injury, including permanent ones.\nPersona: insane\nFriend: sounds like a good last resort for units that are low\nFriend: can you not stack it up so you have for that unit for a while_\nFriend: and are there some ways that unit can be of good value thanks to that unique circumstance?\n\nLike if it will die anyway, good for recon operation maybe or something where death is high chance\n\nor maybe it can pass on knowledge or something\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: You can get a shot in the head and suffer from a permanent brain injury of some type\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\nPersona: like bad back or frail\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\nPersona: and yea you can stack\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I judge courses too much by the crowd\nPersona: like ITU really turned me off for some reason, althought I talked to very few. I visually judged lol. Thats bad\nPersona: this is CBS people\nPersona: fucking gorgeous, but evolutionary unfit\nFriend: ah yeah. maybe \na little more than 6 I think\n\ncause I didn't have full su first education\nFriend: I affirm\nFriend: but .. idk\n\nthere is a lot of that in life too\nPersona: of what?\nPersona: visual judging?\nPersona: or juding by crowd?\nFriend: both\n\nthink it's efficient to stick around ppl with looks\nFriend: just like in stock market because you assume market is efficient and someone else did the math, best to invest in whats going up\nFriend: xd idk that didnt make sense\nPersona: It made sense after I read it twice\nPersona: but it may not be because somebody did the math\nPersona: price went up. Somebody thought somebody did the math\nPersona: but nobody did the math\nFriend: exactly\nPersona: but so many people baught that the buying changed the math itself, so now the math is suddently good anyways\nPersona: time to write that personal statement. Fuck I hope I can go to sleep soon\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So random, I will catch up on the rest of convo later (I got 2%)\nPersona: then you would be in danger of curing depression by drowing. I sense something sus here\nPersona: \"for safety reasons piwko is recomended\" I have the impression many polish people apply this as mantra to many situations\nPersona: I think jokes floating around in my lithuanian friend group distorted my understanding of autistic\nPersona: oh yeah, I flex everytime. When I am making coffee at work and choose between all the inclusive selection of milks, I must not take the lactose free one. I want my lactose. I always make sure I take one with lactose and I announce it verbally\nPersona: I just noticed the message didnt sent and my phone died yesterday \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I would not do this at 10 in the morning \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: atleast not so intensely animated\nFriend: excellent choice \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: oh no, bathtub is your idea. that's a you problem \ud83d\ude44\nFriend: my only battle is trying not to choke on beer\nFriend: speaking of Poland. I think your Pole magnet properties are at work again, because looks like a Polish lad is moving into my old room \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: at least I'm glad that all the new equipment I paid for is going to serve my nation\nFriend: oh yeah, fair enough. everyone uses this term very deliberately\nFriend: same with gaslightimg and narcissim. which drives me crazy\nFriend: yes, must maintain intense eye contact with coworkers while doing so\nPersona: oh wait, when you said the recipe for your recipe I never realized this challenge. You must look deadly funny drinking piwko lying flat on the ground. A true piwko akrobat\nPersona: recipe for your ritual*\nPersona: my best polish friend is leaving denmark for a long while or maybe forever today. The universe sends me a replacement. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be\nPersona: what is the correct meaning of narcissism then?\nPersona: and how do people use it wrong?\nPersona: force them to submission. milk tolerance dominance. everytime\nFriend: this is an extreme sport. when I was little my mum always told me not to drink while lying down bc apparently there is a story of a girl who did that once, choked and went into coma\nFriend: I'm so mad. I was waiting 2 years for fsb to give me my own polish person in the kitchen \ud83d\ude20\nFriend: idk people just tend to diagnose every person who wronged them with a mental illness\nPersona: my finding at 2 am today\nPersona: unrelated to anything\nPersona: (the video is the same, it just showed that it couldn't send, so I sent it again)\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I copied from internet mostly, so I don't sound too frustrated\nPersona: this is perfect\nFriend: javascript\nPersona: i think I know this\nFriend: Am I retarded\nPersona: what? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: xd\nPersona: funny\nPersona: or are you asking if you are r\u0119tarded?\nPersona: Lol I think how I see myself in the mirror is worse than I actually am\nFriend: I ask\nPersona: no not at all \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I honestly think that you may think of yourself much less than atleast what looks you have\nFriend: Cause when you are retarded maybe you don't know\nPersona: oh\nPersona: I thought its about the looks\nFriend: That im curious too but its just too lucky i got\nPersona: oh\nFriend: So i thought maybe im not lucky and its for a reason\nPersona: how does it have to do with being retarded?\nPersona: lol\nPersona: thats overthinking at its finest\nFriend: Cause maybe i am and colleagues pitty me and give me a win for the competition\nFriend: I did the math. Its more likely\nPersona: this is a reddit post. \n\nI though I am retarded because I guessed a 1/400 random number\nPersona: oh\nPersona: in that way\nPersona: but why out of pity?\nFriend: Wanna bike the holiday?\nIm taking the dino for a ride maybe\nFriend: Cause im retarded"

With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\nPersona: haha\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty.

Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\nFriend: to help you get there?\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\nPersona: Need to fix that\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nFriend: exactly :D\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Nice\nFriend: So pong can attack\nNot just def\nPersona: hm\nPersona: i need to read that\nFriend: On thebottom youcan find links to two papers\nOne being about mitigating cowardice in ML\nFriend: I'll start laundry and go to BIG \nWanna join? \n\nLater im free if you want to play or hang out\nPersona: I played too much\nPersona: sorry man\nPersona: I have addiction\nPersona: Everynow and then I get this episodical gaming addiction. I have even started to recognize stages and hopefully about to end one now.\nFriend: Damn\nFriend: You go full psychologist on yourself?\nPersona: Stage 1: The first days yesterday. I start ignoring completely everything, don't check my phones, don't eat, drink, try to do toilet breaks as quick as possible. Game till 5 AM, when\nStage 2: The last day. I know I need to stop gaming a bit earlier this time as I need some time for aftergaming recovery. Its usually watching a film or taking a very long shower or combination.\nStage 3: The first attempt to go back to life. I force yourself to not game. Just don't play. Usually I end up procrastinating with a lot of videos about games on Youtube, saying just one more video and so on. Its not playing to barier to entry is very quick and it does not get me too deatched from life. But my mind is occupied still with the game.\nPersona: Today is Stage 3\nPersona: I had to work since 12 today. Haven;t started yet\nPersona: But my YT history is all Rimworld.\nPersona: God, why I can't be addicted like this to some stuff that rewards me physically or socially or monetarily\nPersona: But dude Rimworld is OP\nPersona: My life goal is to have a whole 2 free weeks, without missing out on anything and just nolife Rimworld or Minecraft Modpacks\nPersona: Reallife is overrated\nFriend: Weird theory\nGuys after coming smell better to girls\nFriend: Got a hard drive i can burrows or flash drive? Got like 20 GB need\nFriend: Need for 1 week\nPersona: I have flash\nPersona: 32gb I think\nPersona: Today I am home until 16, you can drop by pick up\nPersona: I am home late though\nPersona: tommorow I am home in morning I thinj\nPersona: how\nPersona: explain more\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I judge courses too much by the crowd\nPersona: like ITU really turned me off for some reason, althought I talked to very few. I visually judged lol. Thats bad\nPersona: this is CBS people\nPersona: fucking gorgeous, but evolutionary unfit\nFriend: ah yeah. maybe \na little more than 6 I think\n\ncause I didn't have full su first education\nFriend: I affirm\nFriend: but .. idk\n\nthere is a lot of that in life too\nPersona: of what?\nPersona: visual judging?\nPersona: or juding by crowd?\nFriend: both\n\nthink it's efficient to stick around ppl with looks\nFriend: just like in stock market because you assume market is efficient and someone else did the math, best to invest in whats going up\nFriend: xd idk that didnt make sense\nPersona: It made sense after I read it twice\nPersona: but it may not be because somebody did the math\nPersona: price went up. Somebody thought somebody did the math\nPersona: but nobody did the math\nFriend: exactly\nPersona: but so many people baught that the buying changed the math itself, so now the math is suddently good anyways\nPersona: time to write that personal statement. Fuck I hope I can go to sleep soon\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yup, eventually you surprass that. I don't know how to make ideas come better though\nFriend: how are u awake?\nPersona: yeah but its mostly because of the damned DO. If not DO I would be much healthier\nFriend: and fucntioning\nFriend: hahaha\nFriend: A few weeks ago i was taking care of my horse bc he was sick so for 3 days straight both night and day I had to check on him and do some medical stuff every 2 hours without breaks\nPersona: I may have addiciton to energy drinks\nFriend: i ahve never felt more tourtured in my life and now whenever i feel sorry for myself i remind myself that i am showing pussy behavior compared to that\nPersona: :OO\nPersona: Thats crazy\nPersona: thats so disrupting wtf\nPersona: can't someone else paid do that?\nFriend: jesus airi and u laugh at my coke addiction\nPersona: I think it sounds worse than it is. Its like maybe one a day on average. And they are sugar free so its not worse than coffee I think\nFriend: u know when you have been sick in your liver the doctors will allow you to drink alcohol before they allow you to drink energy drinks.....\nFriend: thats pretty disturbing\nPersona: Reallly?\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: Fuck, okay I gotta rethink\nFriend: my sister was really sick one with her liver and literally even 2 years after the doctors still advised her not to drink it\nPersona: Ah fuck you are right\nPersona: I just Googled it\nFriend: hahaha\nFriend: yeha\nPersona: You may have saved my liver in the long run, thanks <3\nFriend: its scary\nPersona: but now its up to me to change it\nPersona: but wtf, why we can't have nice things\nPersona: Energy drinks literally makes me happy\nFriend: but i mean i drink a fuck ton of coke so i am not that mich better myself\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what methods did you discover?\nPersona: share them, I am interested for my own utility \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: spreadsheets?\nPersona: Hunger is so annoying like, idk what to ea\nPersona: eat*\nPersona: I am so bored of cooking and eating\nPersona: I wish to have like automatic eating\nFriend: Almost no spreadsheets. Just abusing google calendar and reporting daily to Kinga (it goes both ways). Perfect way to keep ourselves accountable and maintain long distance friendship \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: how did you manage to do assigments in a week after they are assigned? I would have big will power problems\nPersona: I've been lately experimenting a lot with calender too, come up with this one method, working good so far, but not mature to share yet\nPersona: Once a few weeks? :oooo\nPersona: Hm\nPersona: I do mass cooking every week, but I dont freeze stuff\nPersona: Shopping wise, hm perhaps I could try online\nPersona: maybe I should also try freezing\nPersona: Overall I feel like there is a lot in common that we do regarding this whole productivity theory\nFriend: I see them as something to \u201eget rid of\u201d xd Assignments are related to what we had on the lectures/classes. Doing the them helps me understand the most important concepts and I don\u2019t have to study that much later on.\nFriend: As I said, my \u201ctechniques\u201d are no rocket science but it took me some time to build and adapt this mindset\nFriend: Yeah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m only eating frozen meals but the thing is that I don\u2019t have to cook if I don\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s why I also mentioned having ingredients for all of the basic and quick meals.\nFor me it\u2019s mainly oatmeal, pasta and miso soup. I can make these in around 15min so I don\u2019t consider it as \u201ccooking\u201d\nFriend: Oh and also, with my lifestyle it\u2019s very inconvenient to do it differently. As I have a few projects going on, there\u2019s more important and fun stuff to worry about than throwing all nighters to do some assignments ;) that\u2019s the engine for my will power\nPersona: a nice danish song\nPersona: with english part\nPersona: ugh, yeah, but they are usuallly at low urgency after they get assigned\nPersona: I stopped eating oatmeal rn. I got too bored finally\nFriend: I\u2019m preparing for a hybrid way of living that I wish to have. Soo being able to work and study anywhere anytime? Check. Having (almost) no fresh produce in the fridge? Check. Minimising the amount of stuff that I own? Check.\n\nHaving all that brings me lots of convenience and peace\nPersona: true, the goal of this semester for now is to not have any allnighters\nPersona: its the bane of my will to live\nFriend: So be the one who creates that urgency. Treat yourself with doing more important things after you get rid of those\nPersona: that is a nice setup\nFriend: I have classes only on some of the weekends so usually I start working on notes and assignments in the evenings during the weekend or on the first few days after that(for bigger assignments). Is it tiring? Yes. But does it pay off? Very much\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Bit overwhelming for me compared to notion cause im used to ui\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: its a more complex operation\nPersona: its when I have a line breaks in one topic, it takes the last line, cuts it, and puts it in a new topic below\nPersona: rarely useful\nPersona: spent more time making than utilizing I think\nPersona: Sooooo useful\nPersona: best idea i had was checkpoints\nPersona: help shows only one buy there are more, just press diff number\nPersona: why do you need to learn it?\nPersona: you just use it\nPersona: okay i take my words back\nPersona: it has markdown syntax plus some other syntax idk the name of\nPersona: but the syntax is same as Logseq actually, maybe thats why I thought you just take it and use it\nPersona: I use notion and logseq at work. Notion is really nice for project maagement and has a half amazing half decent table (database) functionality. But for personal wiki I prefer Logseq\nFriend: Markdown is ez pz\n\nThe usefulness comes from the extensions and those are a bit intimidating\nPersona: ah okay, I didn't try much extensions\nPersona: I didn't like obsidian because it has stupid functionality for block references. Its more page based.\nPersona: And it also has much more primitived block embed functinality (make a editable reference to a block). You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. On Logseq this is possible, fully native, and easy.\nPersona: Thats the feature I was dreaming about in MindManager for so long\nPersona: I don't like page based, because a big task in note-taking is deciding where to put what and then deciding where to look for what. If you also need to think about pages, then its an extra variable in your decision making process.\nPersona: Logseq automates that, so any single block can be a page, you just press on it to zoom in and it becomes the root element\nPersona: But they also have pages (which is sometimes till needed so files don't get too large and if you want to collaborate, so you can work in diff files, like in coding)\nPersona: The only issue with Logseq is that its less stable and feels a little weirder and less polished than Obsidian. Obsidian is super smooth\nPersona: Next semester I will try switching uni notes to Logseq, but I am a little anxious. There will be many improvements with that - like I can't wait till I can use block embeds, also I will be able to share my notes with other people in a standardized format. Search functionality is better too.\nPersona: But I am anxious that the mindmap layout presentation will turn out to be much more superior to bullet list presentation when it comes to complex topics I will study. Also in Logseq there is less options for content visual customization, so making things standout is more limited (bolding, colors still work).\nPersona: bruuug sweet\nPersona: you look good\nFriend: Thanks man\nWas a good time\nFriend: I'm happy she wants to show me\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Nej Victor can't come bcuz of work\nPersona: got it. no one else on your mind?\nPersona: A lot of ppl are in Roskilde tmmrow\nPersona: Do you want to hit roskilde tommorow around evening, stand where ppl exit, if they exit for good, ask for free tickets?\nPersona: By tickets I meant the wrist bands\nFriend: Bro let's fucking do it\nFriend: What time?\nFriend: Also should be bring sleeping gear just in case?\nPersona: I dont know, around evening. Concerts end at 3am so thats going to be a big outflux for sure, but maybe we can find smth before\nPersona: Yash, another friend of mine you met at Fight club is also down for thia\nPersona: Saturday can rain a lot, so I guess a tent would be good. I saw some cheap one at fotex, but maybe we get tickets first, I am not sure\nPersona: Or maybe its worth getting a tent anyways\nFriend: I think my roommates got tents that I could borrow\nFriend: I will find out asap\nPersona: whats your plan today?\nPersona: You want to meet a little bit earlier?\nFriend: Yo I am open to whatever, what do you think?\nFriend: Tomorrow will be kinda fucked on weather though from early morning, I don't think it makes sense to stay the night\nPersona: Yeah I know about the shit weather, thats why I think more people will leaving today. But if we get in for free, we got nothing to lose\nPersona: I think I will take a shower now and then I am down to meet, we can go to roskilde anytime\nFriend: I feel like the rain would ruin it for me, it's a bit too much commitment with all the dirt, cold and wetness\nPersona: the festival ends Sunday\nPersona: congrats on the new client\nPersona: if its important, just focus and work on it\nPersona: there will be plenty of times to party\nPersona: Roskilde is ending on Sunday and there is nothing that day playing.\nFriend: Thank you my G it's a big deal for me and it's pretty stressful\nPersona: I am down just going there for the night, I have at least 5 good friends who are now at Roskilde, so joining their camp the is the option. No camping. Just staying and partying during the night, until it gets too rough, then train back to cph\nPersona: But probably not going to that alone, Yash is bailing out idk why, he was the guy wanting it since the beginning haha\nPersona: So if its too wild for you tonight, which is totally understandable, since you got real business todo, I am down for a more chill night out too.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: what is this sorcery. what's your secret\nFriend: what\nPersona: ugh I am having a good laugh thanks\nPersona: it was so genius, I typed \"vertical pattern\"\nPersona: but come on come on, finish fixing what you started\nPersona: I think we culturaly match, or we match in humour. Or maybe its because I have soplica\nPersona: which of the two meanings is more like the \"American Psycho\"?\nFriend: now I don't want to! I've just come to a conclusion that I'm clearly better at dodgeball than at fixing things. change of career path is canceled\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e inserting Jaros\u0142aw after talking about plane crashes? how dare you\nFriend: the latter, strangely enough\nPersona: you were close, I admit it was my mistake this time. Dont give up, resist urge to dodge, sometimes in dodgeball its better to catch it\nPersona: generally schedule is flexible\nPersona: doesnt that make Jaroslaws greeting even better here? \ud83c\udf39\u2615\ufe0f\u2615\ufe0f\nFriend: oh no, now we're having a Schrodinger's schedule\nFriend: alright\nFriend: I'LL GO FIRST\nFriend: generally I can't do Sat or Sun\nFriend: and next week I'm pretty booked\nFriend: but after that I have something on 19, 21, 23, 27, 28.02 and 1.03\nFriend: you were so close to inserting Jaros\u0142aw at 2137. we would have no choice, but to give you an honorary Polish citizenship if you did that\nFriend: wait that was ambiguous, I have stuff I need to do on these days. other than that I should be free\nPersona: I am pretty sure I can adapt to be free most of these days\nPersona: would be ideal so somehow induce the same 3 AM conversation type, preferably ealier haha\nPersona: maybe 23rd\nPersona: ohh\nPersona: Even tho I read this, my brain disregarded it \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: you are busy every single weekend. Damn you must going out a lot\nPersona: I wanted to sneak into ITU scroll bar for a while - they state they only allow itu students. I think they are only available on fridays though\nPersona: what are the things you wanted to do for a while, that can be doable together?\nPersona: cause all I can think is stupid or kinda lame \ud83d\ude02"

Text below:\nConversations between persona and friends\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\nPersona: haha\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Nice\nFriend: So pong can attack\nNot just def\nPersona: hm\nPersona: i need to read that\nFriend: On thebottom youcan find links to two papers\nOne being about mitigating cowardice in ML\nFriend: I'll start laundry and go to BIG \nWanna join? \n\nLater im free if you want to play or hang out\nPersona: I played too much\nPersona: sorry man\nPersona: I have addiction\nPersona: Everynow and then I get this episodical gaming addiction. I have even started to recognize stages and hopefully about to end one now.\nFriend: Damn\nFriend: You go full psychologist on yourself?\nPersona: Stage 1: The first days yesterday. I start ignoring completely everything, don't check my phones, don't eat, drink, try to do toilet breaks as quick as possible. Game till 5 AM, when\nStage 2: The last day. I know I need to stop gaming a bit earlier this time as I need some time for aftergaming recovery. Its usually watching a film or taking a very long shower or combination.\nStage 3: The first attempt to go back to life. I force yourself to not game. Just don't play. Usually I end up procrastinating with a lot of videos about games on Youtube, saying just one more video and so on. Its not playing to barier to entry is very quick and it does not get me too deatched from life. But my mind is occupied still with the game.\nPersona: Today is Stage 3\nPersona: I had to work since 12 today. Haven;t started yet\nPersona: But my YT history is all Rimworld.\nPersona: God, why I can't be addicted like this to some stuff that rewards me physically or socially or monetarily\nPersona: But dude Rimworld is OP\nPersona: My life goal is to have a whole 2 free weeks, without missing out on anything and just nolife Rimworld or Minecraft Modpacks\nPersona: Reallife is overrated\nFriend: Weird theory\nGuys after coming smell better to girls\nFriend: Got a hard drive i can burrows or flash drive? Got like 20 GB need\nFriend: Need for 1 week\nPersona: I have flash\nPersona: 32gb I think\nPersona: Today I am home until 16, you can drop by pick up\nPersona: I am home late though\nPersona: tommorow I am home in morning I thinj\nPersona: how\nPersona: explain more\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: idkk, I was realy acitted indeed, idk why, I think just because I wanted to see you \ud83d\ude18\nPersona: But idk if I am feeling for techno today\nPersona: Are you taking drugs? xd\nFriend: Alrighty no worries, I was just curious\nFriend: Most probably not\nPersona: alright buddy, see ya tommorow, have a good rave\nPersona: if you in need fir a chauffeur for the night let me know\nFriend: Alrighty, see ya tomorrow!\nPersona: Tommorow 14:30 movie is Dumb Money, price 60dkk at Palace, me and Petyo (and prob his gf) are going\nPersona: Do you want to join?\nPersona: with Kaja\nPersona: So I can be a third wheel for two couples \ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Boulders are at 4pm\nFriend: So I can't xd\nPersona: we can go to boulders at 17\nPersona: but if you are busy or dont want, no worriea\nPersona: I founs this thesis by a CBS masters student about P2P loans\nPersona: I didnt read all of it, but the conclusions was that the one who already returned well for a few months are less likely to default, as they usually default in the beginning\nPersona: so I looked up on one of my platforms secondary market, where people can liquidate/resell their investments\nPersona: and I know there are some ppl who always try to do it for some premium, say 2-7%, so they get instant profit a bit without waiting\nPersona: I then browsed for loans that already returned more than 6 months on time and has less than 2-3 years left. If a loan has a rate like 25%+, even if the person is asking for 5% premium, I could buy it and then it would become a 20% loan for me, but with lower risk, as the person was already paying on time for a while\nPersona: I think I got a history of 400+ loans, I been looking forward to doing some analysis to actually find strategies to optimize this\nPersona: baught 2 like those right noe\nPersona: now*\nPersona: will check sometimes, and then see\nFriend: uuu and the research was on danish market or european? there can be some cultural differencies which can impact the risk\nFriend: or even economic state, like now we are close to recession so that can also make an impact\nPersona: I dont remember\nPersona: when I see it again I can tell you\nPersona: I need to look into how loans respond to economic downturns\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yup, eventually you surprass that. I don't know how to make ideas come better though\nFriend: how are u awake?\nPersona: yeah but its mostly because of the damned DO. If not DO I would be much healthier\nFriend: and fucntioning\nFriend: hahaha\nFriend: A few weeks ago i was taking care of my horse bc he was sick so for 3 days straight both night and day I had to check on him and do some medical stuff every 2 hours without breaks\nPersona: I may have addiciton to energy drinks\nFriend: i ahve never felt more tourtured in my life and now whenever i feel sorry for myself i remind myself that i am showing pussy behavior compared to that\nPersona: :OO\nPersona: Thats crazy\nPersona: thats so disrupting wtf\nPersona: can't someone else paid do that?\nFriend: jesus airi and u laugh at my coke addiction\nPersona: I think it sounds worse than it is. Its like maybe one a day on average. And they are sugar free so its not worse than coffee I think\nFriend: u know when you have been sick in your liver the doctors will allow you to drink alcohol before they allow you to drink energy drinks.....\nFriend: thats pretty disturbing\nPersona: Reallly?\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: Fuck, okay I gotta rethink\nFriend: my sister was really sick one with her liver and literally even 2 years after the doctors still advised her not to drink it\nPersona: Ah fuck you are right\nPersona: I just Googled it\nFriend: hahaha\nFriend: yeha\nPersona: You may have saved my liver in the long run, thanks <3\nFriend: its scary\nPersona: but now its up to me to change it\nPersona: but wtf, why we can't have nice things\nPersona: Energy drinks literally makes me happy\nFriend: but i mean i drink a fuck ton of coke so i am not that mich better myself\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I have expanded more unfortunatelly\nPersona: whaaaat? fo real? I am in my cozy bed, listening to macmiller\nPersona: why matlab tho?\nFriend: eh mistakes were made. okay, change of the strategy. forget the scale. how does your schedule look like in general\nFriend: what. how many Polish friends do you have haha. you have more Polish friends than I do\nFriend: oh no, I was referring to psycho in a common vernacular sense here. I wasn't even considering the psychiatric sense\nFriend: I wonder whether you'd even feel anything if you fell out. I remember the story of that lady who got sucked out of the window and I think she died almost immediately\nPersona: a very generalized version look like this\nFriend: I'm still basically unfurnished so not home much these days\nFriend: I need it for my potential job and in general it's useful in neuro\nPersona: possibly. They just keep spawning around me\nPersona: \ud83d\ude33\nPersona: there was also a story of a pilot who got sucked out, but somebody held him and he stayed outside of the cabin for a long time and stayed alive.\nPersona: but yeah, chances could be instant death too\nPersona: ohhh\nPersona: why unfurnished?\nPersona: get furniture!\nFriend: this is going great haha\nFriend: also I'm curious what you had to type into Google\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: what is this sorcery. what's your secret\nFriend: what\nPersona: ugh I am having a good laugh thanks\nPersona: it was so genius, I typed \"vertical pattern\"\nPersona: but come on come on, finish fixing what you started\nPersona: I think we culturaly match, or we match in humour. Or maybe its because I have soplica\nPersona: which of the two meanings is more like the \"American Psycho\"?\nFriend: now I don't want to! I've just come to a conclusion that I'm clearly better at dodgeball than at fixing things. change of career path is canceled\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e inserting Jaros\u0142aw after talking about plane crashes? how dare you\nFriend: the latter, strangely enough\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ah I think you showed me that one time :D that was cool\nPersona: having a gf you meanM\nPersona: ?*\nPersona: You wanted that though, plus its a normal thing, productive people learn to manage lives with girlfriends\nFriend: yea\nPersona: How much do you like her?\nPersona: everything into account\nFriend: like gf or normal?\nbecause normal, I think she can be someone important in life\ngf, I'm not sure what to think\nFriend: She reminds me of someone I lost friendship with. And that messes with my perception\nPersona: So like gf, you are not sure\nPersona: And as a friend (normal), she is nice?\nPersona: Its a weird case, does that bothet you a lot?\nPersona: If thats the only problem for gf, then maybe see if this messing with your perception goes away\nFriend: don't think i can stop my head from remembering the other person soon\n\nThink I need more social confirmation and if others like her, then I'd trust that more than myself\nFriend: feeling stupid \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Okay get that social confirmation. I think she has a pretty likeable personality, she seems honest. Looks wise she is not the hottest chick, but in terms of intelligence its a rare find.\nPersona: from my point of view\nFriend: social confirmation received\nPersona: well you should get more\nPersona: if you want to trust it more than yourself\nFriend: I'm having huge confirmation bias now because I see it the same way\nFriend: don't know a girl that I can get an opinion from that I can trust with taht\nPersona: Maybe because we see women in similar way. But ask someone else too if you need more thoughts\nPersona: hmmm. Maybe Luiza?\nFriend: need to be super careful with analyzing her answer because she is always positive :DD\nPersona: or idk maybe even go with the flow, keep looking for other girls. I mean if you need so much of opinions what do others think about it, then maybe you are just forcing yourself to like her. When you actually like/love a girl, it shows clearly.\nFriend: I wonder how her brother would think because he was very religious and has a pure take sometimes\n\nbut honestly don't really want to know. Feel like the only social approval I need is my parents xD\nPersona: Lol I do also seek approval from my dad secretely\nPersona: but he has old fashioned perception of woman\nPersona: holy shit yesterday I had crazy experience\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So random, I will catch up on the rest of convo later (I got 2%)\nPersona: then you would be in danger of curing depression by drowing. I sense something sus here\nPersona: \"for safety reasons piwko is recomended\" I have the impression many polish people apply this as mantra to many situations\nPersona: I think jokes floating around in my lithuanian friend group distorted my understanding of autistic\nPersona: oh yeah, I flex everytime. When I am making coffee at work and choose between all the inclusive selection of milks, I must not take the lactose free one. I want my lactose. I always make sure I take one with lactose and I announce it verbally\nPersona: I just noticed the message didnt sent and my phone died yesterday \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I would not do this at 10 in the morning \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: atleast not so intensely animated\nFriend: excellent choice \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: oh no, bathtub is your idea. that's a you problem \ud83d\ude44\nFriend: my only battle is trying not to choke on beer\nFriend: speaking of Poland. I think your Pole magnet properties are at work again, because looks like a Polish lad is moving into my old room \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: at least I'm glad that all the new equipment I paid for is going to serve my nation\nFriend: oh yeah, fair enough. everyone uses this term very deliberately\nFriend: same with gaslightimg and narcissim. which drives me crazy\nFriend: yes, must maintain intense eye contact with coworkers while doing so\nPersona: oh wait, when you said the recipe for your recipe I never realized this challenge. You must look deadly funny drinking piwko lying flat on the ground. A true piwko akrobat\nPersona: recipe for your ritual*\nPersona: my best polish friend is leaving denmark for a long while or maybe forever today. The universe sends me a replacement. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be\nPersona: what is the correct meaning of narcissism then?\nPersona: and how do people use it wrong?\nPersona: force them to submission. milk tolerance dominance. everytime\nFriend: this is an extreme sport. when I was little my mum always told me not to drink while lying down bc apparently there is a story of a girl who did that once, choked and went into coma\nFriend: I'm so mad. I was waiting 2 years for fsb to give me my own polish person in the kitchen \ud83d\ude20\nFriend: idk people just tend to diagnose every person who wronged them with a mental illness\nPersona: my finding at 2 am today\nPersona: unrelated to anything\nPersona: (the video is the same, it just showed that it couldn't send, so I sent it again)\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic"

Text below:\nConversations between persona and friends\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\nFriend: to help you get there?\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\nPersona: Need to fix that\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nFriend: exactly :D\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: bbut you can make it more creative, there is an option\nPersona: I am wondering why do they like to be the annoying company. Like why they keep pushing Edge. The general internet browser ladder is fully ocupied\nPersona: #1 Chrome #2 Firefox\nPersona: Positioning wisdom says you either be first or second, or you don't be on the same ladder\nPersona: the only ladder that Edge is first at is being the annoying browser thats trying to get attnetion\nPersona: It may not be worse that chrome, but to beat it, it needs to be significantly better\nPersona: Does this actually pass the turing test?\nFriend: :D for sure\nFriend: It added a dot\nFriend: and you quoted without dot\nFriend: hey are you free rn for a minute\nPersona: Now yes\nFriend: I think there is a bug in their system. I'm good\nFriend: I'm trying to call the ministry\nFriend: of edu\nFriend: bro wtf.. \nI love bugs\n\nI got a missed call while I was talking with one lady\nFriend: I call back and some dude picks up\n\nhe called me cause I called him\nFriend: the number looks weird.. I haven't called it before\nFriend: I look him up\n\nhe is some arkitekt\nFriend: I get calls from randoms sometimes too\nFriend: todays bug made me laugh :D\nFriend: I would miss video games or internet without hacking/trolling/random funny bugs\nPersona: \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddfe\nPersona: ups\nPersona: misclick\nPersona: Weird bug\nPersona: how could I have helped you haha?\nPersona: you seemed worried when you sent this\nFriend: Test call ministry of edu\nFriend: Cause their phone isn't working\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what methods did you discover?\nPersona: share them, I am interested for my own utility \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: spreadsheets?\nPersona: Hunger is so annoying like, idk what to ea\nPersona: eat*\nPersona: I am so bored of cooking and eating\nPersona: I wish to have like automatic eating\nFriend: Almost no spreadsheets. Just abusing google calendar and reporting daily to Kinga (it goes both ways). Perfect way to keep ourselves accountable and maintain long distance friendship \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: how did you manage to do assigments in a week after they are assigned? I would have big will power problems\nPersona: I've been lately experimenting a lot with calender too, come up with this one method, working good so far, but not mature to share yet\nPersona: Once a few weeks? :oooo\nPersona: Hm\nPersona: I do mass cooking every week, but I dont freeze stuff\nPersona: Shopping wise, hm perhaps I could try online\nPersona: maybe I should also try freezing\nPersona: Overall I feel like there is a lot in common that we do regarding this whole productivity theory\nFriend: I see them as something to \u201eget rid of\u201d xd Assignments are related to what we had on the lectures/classes. Doing the them helps me understand the most important concepts and I don\u2019t have to study that much later on.\nFriend: As I said, my \u201ctechniques\u201d are no rocket science but it took me some time to build and adapt this mindset\nFriend: Yeah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m only eating frozen meals but the thing is that I don\u2019t have to cook if I don\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s why I also mentioned having ingredients for all of the basic and quick meals.\nFor me it\u2019s mainly oatmeal, pasta and miso soup. I can make these in around 15min so I don\u2019t consider it as \u201ccooking\u201d\nFriend: Oh and also, with my lifestyle it\u2019s very inconvenient to do it differently. As I have a few projects going on, there\u2019s more important and fun stuff to worry about than throwing all nighters to do some assignments ;) that\u2019s the engine for my will power\nPersona: a nice danish song\nPersona: with english part\nPersona: ugh, yeah, but they are usuallly at low urgency after they get assigned\nPersona: I stopped eating oatmeal rn. I got too bored finally\nFriend: I\u2019m preparing for a hybrid way of living that I wish to have. Soo being able to work and study anywhere anytime? Check. Having (almost) no fresh produce in the fridge? Check. Minimising the amount of stuff that I own? Check.\n\nHaving all that brings me lots of convenience and peace\nPersona: true, the goal of this semester for now is to not have any allnighters\nPersona: its the bane of my will to live\nFriend: So be the one who creates that urgency. Treat yourself with doing more important things after you get rid of those\nPersona: that is a nice setup\nFriend: I have classes only on some of the weekends so usually I start working on notes and assignments in the evenings during the weekend or on the first few days after that(for bigger assignments). Is it tiring? Yes. But does it pay off? Very much\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I judge courses too much by the crowd\nPersona: like ITU really turned me off for some reason, althought I talked to very few. I visually judged lol. Thats bad\nPersona: this is CBS people\nPersona: fucking gorgeous, but evolutionary unfit\nFriend: ah yeah. maybe \na little more than 6 I think\n\ncause I didn't have full su first education\nFriend: I affirm\nFriend: but .. idk\n\nthere is a lot of that in life too\nPersona: of what?\nPersona: visual judging?\nPersona: or juding by crowd?\nFriend: both\n\nthink it's efficient to stick around ppl with looks\nFriend: just like in stock market because you assume market is efficient and someone else did the math, best to invest in whats going up\nFriend: xd idk that didnt make sense\nPersona: It made sense after I read it twice\nPersona: but it may not be because somebody did the math\nPersona: price went up. Somebody thought somebody did the math\nPersona: but nobody did the math\nFriend: exactly\nPersona: but so many people baught that the buying changed the math itself, so now the math is suddently good anyways\nPersona: time to write that personal statement. Fuck I hope I can go to sleep soon\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: B or less*\nPersona: I checke my secondary school classmates that were big in sports, year all born between Sep - Dec\nPersona: Yeah*\nPersona: Not big in sports\nPersona: but just\nPersona: A social players\nPersona: And they were the oldest in classs\nPersona: I am march so I guess I am middle\nPersona: nice episode\nPersona: explains about why 2%\nFriend: a book is used and worn having a limited lifespan\n\ndude! That is planned obsolescence\nFriend: that is just a subscription\nPersona: car is a subscription then too?\nPersona: almost every phisical item has limited lifespan\nFriend: Yeah\nCar has high depreciation\nIt just.. it annoyed me to see this comparison because it reminded me of planned obsolescence \n\nIts purposefully making things less durable so that you need to buy replacements\nFriend: And my father saw that with cars\nSo he had this a bit older toyota avensis instead where its cheap and easy to service and you don't need to do it often\nFriend: With bmw now they just extort him for money xD \nAnd he finds alternative ways to order parts and fix with people not form bmw\nPersona: man, do you think when people invented paper and books they had planned obsolence in mind?\nPersona: Also I never fully used up a book\nPersona: Unless you read those books in extreeme conditions and you read the everyday, I dont think it will physically deteriote, especially before you had enough of it\nPersona: I actually never baught a book because some other book in my possesion has physically depreciated\nPersona: I think you are overthinking \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Modern cars may have some planned obselence, yeah. I dont think its as bad as in mobile phone industry\nFriend: no but they are bringing that as an argument of why we can share a book and not share an e-book \ud83d\ude20\n\nOf course it's hard to use up a book\n\nand the best argument is money that should go to the author\n\nauthor would be dead when book is dead probably\nFriend: im just annoyed\ncause publishers make a lot of money too\n\nand capitalism doesn't fare well with the idea of free knowledge\nPersona: \"author would be dead when book is dead\" xdddd\nPersona: lol\nPersona: Ugh I understand, sometimes I get those anoyances too.\nPersona: I feel the same about the industry prefering Excel\nPersona: I recently had to buy books\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so you would have to resort to melee combat, animal etc to fight for you I guess. Or build turrets\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute. If they unfreeeze for a while, say a raid penetrates your base or a unaticipated heatwave heats it up, you will get poluttion in your map and it could be a lot you will need hazmat gear to just survive and clean it up.\nPersona: you could send the pollutioj away via transport pods to your enemies tho\nPersona: that will make them real angry and they will send raids to you\nPersona: there are also sangophuages - pretty much vampires that can live forever but have to drink blood - can be harvested regularly from prisoners\nPersona: There is also luciferium, a drug I never dares to take. It makea you instantly addicted to it and then if you dont consume it regularly, you will die. However it could overtime heal up otherwise unhealable injury, including permanent ones.\nPersona: insane\nFriend: sounds like a good last resort for units that are low\nFriend: can you not stack it up so you have for that unit for a while_\nFriend: and are there some ways that unit can be of good value thanks to that unique circumstance?\n\nLike if it will die anyway, good for recon operation maybe or something where death is high chance\n\nor maybe it can pass on knowledge or something\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: You can get a shot in the head and suffer from a permanent brain injury of some type\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\nPersona: like bad back or frail\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\nPersona: and yea you can stack\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I never found much porn\nPersona: the most nsfw stuff I joined was r/gonewild and r/stupidslutsclub\nPersona: but it was too.distracting\nPersona: but porn finds me\nPersona: r/gonewildstories\nPersona: *\nFriend: maybe you have some sfw filter\nPersona: I dont think so, I see nsfw posts\nFriend: but it is very distracting\nFriend: so i haven't been there much this year\nFriend: then you pick your interest..\nPersona: I am afraid of opening the links\nPersona: I gotta study xd\nPersona: I will refrain\nFriend: wise choice\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\nPersona: I hate that businesses still use Excel instead of G Sheets. Excel user experience is so terrible, it makes me angry everytime. G Sheets have more size limits, but I never really exceeded that. G Sheets also have ArrayFormula and Regex which Excel does not, and those are game changers.\nPersona: That was my rant\nPersona: Especially after I put a link into a cell with some text above in the same cell and everytime I wanted to edit that text in the cell, I clicked on the cell, so the link auto-opened each time, putting browser window in focus and annoying me so  much. Excel opened like 20 tabs of this link. Removing the link also for reason clear the formatting, which is unrelated. G Sheets just create a tool tip kind of thing for cells with link and you can click the link easily, also select from multiple links if there is. It does open always open it without your consent.\nPersona: This is rant extension\nPersona: WTF is this\nPersona: how die the bees got it out?\nPersona: its anti physics\nPersona: my brain is hurtinf seeing this ad\nPersona: did*\nFriend: what\nFriend: i dont get whats that\nPersona: some instagram ad\nPersona: it got the formula right and everything but not the math xdd\nFriend: Whats the right math"

What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\nPersona: haha\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah I think divinity, power, confidence arouses me\nPersona: but divinity would be a kink (if there is one) that is like never achievable. Same with anime porn (forgot how its called)\nPersona: hentai!\nPersona: would have to wait 100 years until they make a full dive simulation experience and satisfy my divine needs\nPersona: Greek times must have been fun, they believed they were real, they had a dream. I am sure they jerked off to the marble sculptures\nPersona: Look at this mood\nPersona: the view through window is picturesque\nFriend: Daamn\nFriend: I see the beauty now of seeing far\nFriend: Im not complaining but prefer yours atm\nPersona: nice wallpaper xd\nPersona: My dream view is to live high up and have a view on an open busy street. That gives me this hard to describle economic feeling\nPersona: The feeling that economic action is happening, supply and demand is meeting, decimal points are changing\nPersona: Locality? whats tht\nFriend: daamn\nFriend: i guess hq\nPersona: :DDDD\nPersona: :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\nPersona: nice\nPersona: I was using ChatGPT for help with flutter and it understood most of the questions really well until I got to this. It gave me a properpy reference of a default Flutter libary object that does not exist. I searched in google for any references to this property, but nobody ever mentioned it.\nPersona: Then when I asked him if he was sure, he responded with this xdddd\nPersona: \"I don't have an apple, but instead I have an apple\"\nFriend: Wth\nFriend: Well i hope it works good cause tomorrow i got exam\nPersona: :Ddd\nPersona: Good luck\nPersona: this is perfect\nPersona: my slave OpenAI\nFriend: god damn\nFriend: those are some good question followings to get a linkedin response\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which the others didn\u2019t have\nFriend: so we should maybe be ready to answer something more abt that\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: We have some work to do today\nPersona: excuse me, whos Savanna? \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: I\u2019m dumb and I literally came up with the name too ahhaha\nPersona: I found empty room SP212\nFriend: You\u2019re not there anymore are you ?\nFriend: majority of questions were about the paper and she asked us some super paper-specific questions but also about our design-thinking, customer personas and how we developed them, then alternative launch strategies (and here she wanted super specific names like even when describing how micromarket strategy would apply to our case we didnt say the specific name and used \"niche market\" instead so she wanted to know what is the actual CORRECT strategy name) and then at the end she gave us both a few questions on other theories from the course which she assigned directly to a person. in that part we had multiple questions about servitization so what it is, how it changes the customer relationship with the company and value and etc. it is 95% christiane asking the questions i think the external dude asked us only 1 question that was related to developing a platform since it's his area of expertise or smth. during the exam i thought everything was chill tho cuz we answered correctly to all the questions that she asked us even with theories and stuff but when she gave grade feedback she then thought that we \"didnt hit certain keywords\" she wanted to hear so in our case atleast it  felt that she was excessively critical\nPersona: Which campus are we meeting on?\nFriend: The exam is at Dalgas so I would prefer to meet there\nFriend: Me 2\nPersona: might be hard to practice speech there tho\nFriend: We should be able to find somewhere\nFriend: Previously I\u2019ve been able to find spare rooms there\nFriend: Its one of the last days of exams too\nPersona: okay\nFriend: I think it\u2019s very weird that she hints at theories and wants us to name them\nFriend: Like the 4 letter nice one etc.\nFriend: That is very strange imo\nPersona: yeah, would better see if we underatand then and not if we know the labels\nFriend: She kinda puts you on the spot\nFriend: Because it\u2019s hard to remember a name of a theory in the first place but only saying it includes bubbles makes it harder\nPersona: :DDD yeah bubles wtf, anything could be put into boubles\nPersona: But anyways, lets rock the theory tonight\nFriend: that a fucked way to ask\nFriend: bro\nFriend: i am decreased\nFriend: Damn I\u2019m a bit stressed rn\nFriend: A bit worried\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so you would have to resort to melee combat, animal etc to fight for you I guess. Or build turrets\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute. If they unfreeeze for a while, say a raid penetrates your base or a unaticipated heatwave heats it up, you will get poluttion in your map and it could be a lot you will need hazmat gear to just survive and clean it up.\nPersona: you could send the pollutioj away via transport pods to your enemies tho\nPersona: that will make them real angry and they will send raids to you\nPersona: there are also sangophuages - pretty much vampires that can live forever but have to drink blood - can be harvested regularly from prisoners\nPersona: There is also luciferium, a drug I never dares to take. It makea you instantly addicted to it and then if you dont consume it regularly, you will die. However it could overtime heal up otherwise unhealable injury, including permanent ones.\nPersona: insane\nFriend: sounds like a good last resort for units that are low\nFriend: can you not stack it up so you have for that unit for a while_\nFriend: and are there some ways that unit can be of good value thanks to that unique circumstance?\n\nLike if it will die anyway, good for recon operation maybe or something where death is high chance\n\nor maybe it can pass on knowledge or something\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: You can get a shot in the head and suffer from a permanent brain injury of some type\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\nPersona: like bad back or frail\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\nPersona: and yea you can stack\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yup, eventually you surprass that. I don't know how to make ideas come better though\nFriend: how are u awake?\nPersona: yeah but its mostly because of the damned DO. If not DO I would be much healthier\nFriend: and fucntioning\nFriend: hahaha\nFriend: A few weeks ago i was taking care of my horse bc he was sick so for 3 days straight both night and day I had to check on him and do some medical stuff every 2 hours without breaks\nPersona: I may have addiciton to energy drinks\nFriend: i ahve never felt more tourtured in my life and now whenever i feel sorry for myself i remind myself that i am showing pussy behavior compared to that\nPersona: :OO\nPersona: Thats crazy\nPersona: thats so disrupting wtf\nPersona: can't someone else paid do that?\nFriend: jesus airi and u laugh at my coke addiction\nPersona: I think it sounds worse than it is.

I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\nPersona: thats a CV\nPersona: You are hired!\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Apprently you can create a git repository in a Google Drive folder\nPersona: But\nPersona: since I like to learn stuff, I will find a workaround\nPersona: I will do the script later, I got a little bit annoyed while bulding it\nPersona: For now I will manually move items to it from time to time\nFriend: Ill be at DS 12 w/ u\nPersona: alright\nPersona: wya?\nPersona: oh fuck\nPersona: I am.in wronf one\nFriend: 2.08 In 1 sec\nPersona: btw in case you missed it, I shared the cases with you on a G drive invite\nPersona: The first case is super cool tho\nFriend: I saw thx\nFriend: Just finished it. It sure sounds like an interesting org 2 work in!\nFriend: I\u2019ll sit by the left side\nFriend: Plz bring a charger\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nPersona: Hey, I have been looking (a abit today, felt a bit bad) into the market research methods, also specifically into few, but will look more into it. I think focus groups is a solid choice but I already found some alternatives, and maybe there can be more.\nPersona: Its still WIP, but see some of the methodologies I mapped in my notes (linked to the For Elias) part\nPersona: I pushed to repo\nPersona: Hey, I'll skip the class today, cause I am a little sick\nFriend: I'll check it out. I've been thinking a lot about how we will present a certain product 2 the digital personas, and I feel like it's going to be challenging 2 not embed bias. Do u have any idea about that?\nFriend: Why is it it's called WIP?\nFriend: I'll share my notes. Hope u feel better soon!<3\nFriend: git config --global alias.cp '!git add . && git commit -m \"Quick update\" && git push'\nFriend: git config --global alias.up 'pull origin main'\nFriend: Here is 2 alias scripts.

Can't meet requirements with CBS BSc\nPersona: Probably\nPersona: Moving in together? wowowowwo\nPersona: Random. What is your dream career role?\nFriend: Our typical place?\nFriend: Maybe!\nParents might help with down-payment for real place\n\nBut for now it's mostly informative \n\nHave to learn all things to look out for and get a feeling of what things are worth\nFriend: Dream?\nThe dream would be to be comfortable with my knowledge and able to work big projects\n\nRn i have very limited powers in IT\nFriend: The things maybe i gave you tips on\nI want to feel like that, but for bigger projects\nFriend: Hopefully i can grow in a company and get to a place like that\nPersona: yeah,  but I will try again\nPersona: good idea\nPersona: maybe you can message Marcus\nPersona: he has just baught an apartment\nFriend: Nice! He is danish too\nWill write him\nFriend: \"\nFeeling extreme cold from time to time (like we probably would in a natural habitat) significantly reduces inflammatory processes in the body. Therefore some diseases are treated this way already - like rheumatic inflammations of the joints - with very good results.\n\nAlso since cancer often starts with untreated inflammatory processes, exposing yourself to extreme cold from time to time could be a very good way to reduce your personal cancer risk.\n\nPlus: studies induce that it works with extreme heat as well.\"\nFriend: wonder what cancer rates of danes are\n\nsince they do cold and sauna\nFriend: The highest cancer rate for men and women combined was in Denmark at 334.9 people per 100,000.\n\nnvm xD\nFriend: can also be a function of testing.. not gonna make conclusions off of that\nPersona: do you like it?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections.

Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I also am depending on the circumstances\nFriend: yeah I guess but\nPersona: pure autism\nFriend: lol\nPersona: like give me an situation in which you feel that you might be weird or autistic?\nFriend: yeah socially I've been avoiding people and really anxious about social situations\n\nand when I've looked for contact, people have been weirded out\nFriend: so the question is if I was poorly socialized so I did weird stuff or was just bit of autist\nPersona: What did you do before you went to KEA first time?\nPersona: I was also very anxious and avoided people when I used to play too much video games\nPersona: I had this period in my middle school\nPersona: If I felt the same way right now as an adult, I might feel like smth wrong or I am weird\nFriend: There is the thing that autism is harder to detect in adults because when you grow you kind of learn to act normal\nPersona: but what do you people when you look for contact, people are weirded out? Like these days, right now? Is it only about girls or including boys?\nPersona: then so many of us may have autism and we are just pretending to act normal lol\nPersona: Cause honestly, I do act a lot of stuff to reach my goals or make an impression to some person\nPersona: Maybe I am also an autist then\nPersona: I don't really know, I think I know too little about it.\nPersona: for me the better understanding is the word 'weird'\nFriend: yeah \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nthe thing that prompted me to be curious now is the 5 love languages\nFriend: have you heard of that thing\nPersona: is it like words, touch, and some 3 more?\nFriend: yee ye!\nFriend: but then there are these 5 others and I'm questioning if those 5 others are the ones for autists\nFriend: or if normal people can also identify with them\nPersona: 5 others. Like 5 love languages for autists?\nFriend: ye :DD\nFriend: you remember I keep asking to meet and just study together or do our thing but separately\nFriend: the exact thing is stated as one of them\nFriend: idk.. would have to test on people if they identify with any of these to see\nPersona: But why?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: MVC\n\nModel view controller\n\nBackend \nFrontend\nBackend\n\nXD \nIm confused if they look for a fullstacker and not a frontender\nFriend: But they do put some really hardcore frontend stuff like A11y, SSR  \nAnd then they ask a bunch of backend shit or cms stuff\nFriend: Wtf is happening outside atm\nPersona: bro I drove with car this morning at 8\nPersona: crazy\nPersona: Sllid once a bit just to test the waters\nFriend: Wowow\nFriend: Nice?\nPersona: was a bit scary at firat\nPersona: firat\nPersona: first\nPersona: especially since the breaks were a bit sus\nPersona: but then I think it was the ABS kicking in\nFriend: Yeah abs annoying for drift\nThats why you use handbreak xD\nPersona: Idk, but it protect me from unintentional drift xd\nFriend: Abs good\nI tested abs on thebike tosay\nPersona: do you even need pedal brake for drift?\nPersona: it exists?\nFriend: Lot of snow in the backalley and when i go fast i pretend to break with abs\nPersona: xdddddd\nFriend: Yeah just push break til wheel locks, release\nAnd do that fast\nFriend: Pedal breaks\nPersona: yeah nice\nFriend: Basically put pressure/weight on the leg pressing and release\nBit like jumping on one leg\nFriend: Not great for drift but good stability\nPersona: oh you break witg legs\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: forgot\nPersona: but bike is not that damgerous antways. I tend to not think about braking safety and distance when on bike xdd\nPersona: for some reason cars seem much more responsible and scary to me\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\nFriend: nooo\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\nFriend: I love that clip\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\nFriend: other than Venus\nFriend: because that would suck\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\nPersona: you have good ideas\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah,  but I will try again\nPersona: good idea\nPersona: maybe you can message Marcus\nPersona: he has just baught an apartment\nFriend: Nice! He is danish too\nWill write him\nFriend: \"\nFeeling extreme cold from time to time (like we probably would in a natural habitat) significantly reduces inflammatory processes in the body. Therefore some diseases are treated this way already - like rheumatic inflammations of the joints - with very good results.\n\nAlso since cancer often starts with untreated inflammatory processes, exposing yourself to extreme cold from time to time could be a very good way to reduce your personal cancer risk.\n\nPlus: studies induce that it works with extreme heat as well.\"\nFriend: wonder what cancer rates of danes are\n\nsince they do cold and sauna\nFriend: The highest cancer rate for men and women combined was in Denmark at 334.9 people per 100,000.\n\nnvm xD\nFriend: can also be a function of testing.. not gonna make conclusions off of that\nPersona: do you like it?\nFriend: Yeah man\nIt fit the vibe real good\nFriend: But idk what he says\n\nTurns out its lithuanian\nFriend: Is it good? :D\nFriend: It sounds fire\nFriend: What you do friday? We graduate and it would be fun if you join\nPersona: Not an artist I know or that is in known in Lithuanian. Some good rap would be OG Version\nPersona: but the vibe is not bad\nPersona: this one is my recent fav\nPersona: not super popular but I like it too\nPersona: I think I have plans already\nPersona: I will see if the plans are still up\nPersona: Will let u knoe\nPersona: play these and you will get respect in lithuania\nFriend: whats your next bite\nPersona: B or C\nFriend: you don't deserve B until you have C\nFriend: good choice :D tho\nFriend: are you strict with the order?\nFriend: I know there are times when I can go C->A \nand leave B for the end\nPersona: Not strict\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I judge courses too much by the crowd\nPersona: like ITU really turned me off for some reason, althought I talked to very few. I visually judged lol. Thats bad\nPersona: this is CBS people\nPersona: fucking gorgeous, but evolutionary unfit\nFriend: ah yeah. maybe \na little more than 6 I think\n\ncause I didn't have full su first education\nFriend: I affirm\nFriend: but .. idk\n\nthere is a lot of that in life too\nPersona: of what?\nPersona: visual judging?\nPersona: or juding by crowd?\nFriend: both\n\nthink it's efficient to stick around ppl with looks\nFriend: just like in stock market because you assume market is efficient and someone else did the math, best to invest in whats going up\nFriend: xd idk that didnt make sense\nPersona: It made sense after I read it twice\nPersona: but it may not be because somebody did the math\nPersona: price went up. Somebody thought somebody did the math\nPersona: but nobody did the math\nFriend: exactly\nPersona: but so many people baught that the buying changed the math itself, so now the math is suddently good anyways\nPersona: time to write that personal statement. Fuck I hope I can go to sleep soon\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\nFriend: to help you get there?\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\nPersona: Need to fix that\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nFriend: exactly :D\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do"

Try thinking in different pose\nFriend: will try\nPersona: okay, try that one, will you?\nPersona: I bet you will come up with th best ideas\nPersona: btw, great success today - made friends with two ITU people that will sign me up for Scroll bar\nPersona: I also had a great laugh from this italian data science professor, he kept using the adjective Ultra. Sometimes for him things very even ultra ultra something. Me and my friend my a bet whether he will say \"giga\" and then we also made a bet that if he said ultra ultra ultra (3 time), I would stand up and correct him, that in this case he should say giga.\nPersona: But none of that happen. We concluded that his best one was \"ultra stellar\"\nPersona: made*\nPersona: but I concluded I will probably not apply to ITU\nFriend: why\nPersona: I think one of the programmes at DTU will be better\nFriend: shit, sorry. I was a bit drunk yesterday, and apparently overconfident that I can multi-task during a pee break\nFriend: tbh that why took all the power of my remaining 1.5 brain cells and a headstand\nFriend: but what's the vibe of people there in general? I don't hear anything about that school ever, except that it exists\nFriend: hahah was he so hyped up about itu or about data science?\nFriend: I'm def stealing this one\nFriend: you know, I never really go open days bc I feel like it doesn't really represent the place accurately, i.e. everything seems 1000x better than in reality\nFriend: but I've always wondered whether I'm missing out or not\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: if I can do it (done it in the past successfully), then you should definetely be able to\nPersona: just pee longer\nPersona: Xdddd\nPersona: how much ethanol intoxitacion did you have? \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: although if you did a headstand... well, a short accidental headstand could very well be a symptom of high ethanol intoxication, so its possible I guess\nPersona: yeah, its quite rare to meet the ITU species. Vybe is nerdier, my best discovery was that they host occassional LAN parties (everybody brings they gaming rigs to school and play League, csgo, etc tournaments all night while drinking energy drinks)\nPersona: That I would like to participate abd I got conctacts\nPersona: but I think to find out the real vibe, an experiential visit to the scroll bar must be done. And we already made some connections there that will add us to the guest list this friday. So for that you will have to come with me and find out \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: I think the combination, he kept emphasizing (ultraemphasizing) that its so ultra ultra cool that the lecturers who teach each data science course are also active reaearchers in these topics\nPersona: I kinda took it for granted at CBS, but he was positioning it as a real USP (Unique selling point)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: nice\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\nPersona: yo wtf\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\nPersona: click the three dots\nPersona: and there is install app button\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\nPersona: thats pretty cool\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\nPersona: and mortgages\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\nPersona: this is from a book\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Apprently you can create a git repository in a Google Drive folder\nPersona: But\nPersona: since I like to learn stuff, I will find a workaround\nPersona: I will do the script later, I got a little bit annoyed while bulding it\nPersona: For now I will manually move items to it from time to time\nFriend: Ill be at DS 12 w/ u\nPersona: alright\nPersona: wya?\nPersona: oh fuck\nPersona: I am.in wronf one\nFriend: 2.08 In 1 sec\nPersona: btw in case you missed it, I shared the cases with you on a G drive invite\nPersona: The first case is super cool tho\nFriend: I saw thx\nFriend: Just finished it. It sure sounds like an interesting org 2 work in!\nFriend: I\u2019ll sit by the left side\nFriend: Plz bring a charger\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nPersona: Hey, I have been looking (a abit today, felt a bit bad) into the market research methods, also specifically into few, but will look more into it. I think focus groups is a solid choice but I already found some alternatives, and maybe there can be more.\nPersona: Its still WIP, but see some of the methodologies I mapped in my notes (linked to the For Elias) part\nPersona: I pushed to repo\nPersona: Hey, I'll skip the class today, cause I am a little sick\nFriend: I'll check it out. I've been thinking a lot about how we will present a certain product 2 the digital personas, and I feel like it's going to be challenging 2 not embed bias. Do u have any idea about that?\nFriend: Why is it it's called WIP?\nFriend: I'll share my notes. Hope u feel better soon!<3\nFriend: git config --global alias.cp '!git add . && git commit -m \"Quick update\" && git push'\nFriend: git config --global alias.up 'pull origin main'\nFriend: Here is 2 alias scripts. Put them into your terminal. So u from now on only need 2 \"cd\" into your local version of the repo, and then write \"git cp\" to share yours, and \"git up\" to get mine;)\nPersona: well, a persona must be biast by definition I would assume\nPersona: if you are 0 biast, then you are just a general person, not really a persona\nPersona: Or what kind of bias did you mean?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I also am depending on the circumstances\nFriend: yeah I guess but\nPersona: pure autism\nFriend: lol\nPersona: like give me an situation in which you feel that you might be weird or autistic?\nFriend: yeah socially I've been avoiding people and really anxious about social situations\n\nand when I've looked for contact, people have been weirded out\nFriend: so the question is if I was poorly socialized so I did weird stuff or was just bit of autist\nPersona: What did you do before you went to KEA first time?\nPersona: I was also very anxious and avoided people when I used to play too much video games\nPersona: I had this period in my middle school\nPersona: If I felt the same way right now as an adult, I might feel like smth wrong or I am weird\nFriend: There is the thing that autism is harder to detect in adults because when you grow you kind of learn to act normal\nPersona: but what do you people when you look for contact, people are weirded out? Like these days, right now? Is it only about girls or including boys?\nPersona: then so many of us may have autism and we are just pretending to act normal lol\nPersona: Cause honestly, I do act a lot of stuff to reach my goals or make an impression to some person\nPersona: Maybe I am also an autist then\nPersona: I don't really know, I think I know too little about it.\nPersona: for me the better understanding is the word 'weird'\nFriend: yeah \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nthe thing that prompted me to be curious now is the 5 love languages\nFriend: have you heard of that thing\nPersona: is it like words, touch, and some 3 more?\nFriend: yee ye!\nFriend: but then there are these 5 others and I'm questioning if those 5 others are the ones for autists\nFriend: or if normal people can also identify with them\nPersona: 5 others. Like 5 love languages for autists?\nFriend: ye :DD\nFriend: you remember I keep asking to meet and just study together or do our thing but separately\nFriend: the exact thing is stated as one of them\nFriend: idk.. would have to test on people if they identify with any of these to see\nPersona: But why?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: in*\nPersona: Do you want to also volunteer in Presidents Summit?\nPersona: Yo for friday, I will only free up around 22 tho\nFriend: Whats that\nSend me\nFriend: Oh for going out or what was friday\nPersona: yup\nPersona: but actually after the meeting, I got to know they just started accepting applications this week and they need 100total, they will be reaching out to KU and CBS, so I dont think its hard to be accepted\nFriend: Was at one campus in KU yesterday\nFriend: they had some open day introducing bachelors there\nFriend: I talked with a bunch of people\nwas so ez being social about it\nPersona: nice\nPersona: will save me time not having to yandex \"scihub proxy\" xdd\nPersona: you think cause its KU?\nFriend: I think because of the social setting\n\nThey were they having their tables ready to present the bachelor to people that want to study it\nPersona: ah yeah it was the people behinx counters\nPersona: but generally at bar I found KU ppl easier going\nFriend: And I have some extra social power sometimes so I made them get excited\n\nAsk about their fav subject and then get in depth and discuss some social aspects f ex\nFriend: Maybe its cause KU ppl are chill\nFriend: One dude was slack lining between the trees outside\nPersona: lol, at CBS that would be rare\nFriend: Ye.. talked with 2 guys from cbs and one quit\nSaid he doesntike the whole slick back hair and attitude\nFriend: We gotta chill at KU more\nFriend: Lottsa girls in health and geology and other subjects\nPersona: Ku and I want to try ITU too\nPersona: in 10 years I think I will write a secret book. \"The reverse relationship between mathematical/coding abilities and attractiveness in women\"\nFriend: Yeah!\nFriend: Think it's a relevant book for the time written\nBecause social dynamics define that a lot\nPersona: I now have a little hypothesis that given attractiveness is not only about physical appearance, logical stupidity makes women more attractive\nPersona: but thats illegal stuff\nPersona: and thats also kinda a joke xd\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: lol\nPersona: Yeah I guess its  unit-of-time-invested/unit-of-relationship-utility would give something similar to economic scale and diseconomies of scale graph.\nFriend: i kind of want to test that\nFriend: but some of the questions I feel hard asking them in person if around other people\nFriend: these feel more like 1:1\nFriend: questions\nPersona: yeah, some. Some can be good. Say you are discussing football with someone and they are talking about their achievements, you can go like \"What inspired you to go so far on football?\"\nFriend: I'll be reviewing the questions list when I go out socially and see if I can get something going\nPersona: I should try that aswell, like pulling out this list lol\nPersona: thats super weird\nPersona: imagine somoone noticed\nFriend: \ud83d\ude04\nPersona: But, after a few times I guess I memorize\nPersona: Do you know Loqseq?\nPersona: Its for note-taking\nPersona: today I realized its deep af\nPersona: You can even build custom queries to pull notes.

But competition also bigger\nPersona: I want to find a hot chich at ITU, and shr might be smart also by default\nFriend: You gotta go design schools like kea\nFriend: Hospitality\nPersona: hm, I think kea would be in between\nFriend: If you look for lower competition and looks\nPersona: no.no, I am looking for the impossible woman\nPersona: thats hot and smart\nPersona: ITU default is prob smart\nFriend: Ye\nPersona: i mean I define smart in my own definition xddd\nFriend: Manyguys tho\nPersona: smart as in likes number and code xdd\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: This is a feature not a bug\nYoubsee how much you slept over\nPersona: xddd\nPersona: its for summit keynote launch\nPersona: at my work there is this girl\nPersona: Ugne\nPersona: also a Lithuanian\nPersona: she worked as a customer service/specialist for 1-2 years and then pushed really she said to be put on the developer team\nPersona: Now she is doing front-end with react for the app\nPersona: The thing is, she is quite pretty even to my standards\nPersona: of course, not paradox breaking pretty, but getting closer\nPersona: but also she is front end. Frony end people tends to be less unattractive than back-end hardcore devs\nFriend: \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: xddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: I think thats just reality\nPersona: hard choice\nPersona: beautiful pussy of life fulfilment in code\nPersona: ketchup or mayo\nPersona: New item on bucket list:\ngit commit and git push while balls deep into a hot chich\nFriend: Wtf im losing the thread \nBut this is funny af\nPersona: Bro I have a crazy idea\nPersona: Ok its not so crazy, its just my another code project idea\nPersona: but I think its crazy\nPersona: What if I pull my all of my facebook messenger conversation data (I did this before and its quite easy to work with it) and then see how can I exploit it using GPT\nPersona: Like messenger data, even stripped of all of the media data, I think still holds a lot of data about so many thinks. \n\nSo many things can be concluded about oneself and individual people just from conversations.\nPersona: Like if you use GPT to query our chat about me, you can pretty much have AI come up with many answers relating to me. My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done. Its a little science.\nPersona: Fuck I wish I had all the time in the world\nFriend: what needs to be done\nPersona: wow wsb is working\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: what are you up to with studies and all\nPersona: ughh tough times\nPersona: funnilly, the main thing on  my mind was driving xddd\nPersona: I would drive to Lidl, 10km just for the sake of it xddd\nPersona: need a ride somewhere? xd\nFriend: :DD\nFriend: when do you wanna go\nPersona: anytime\nFriend: I wanna code some stuff.

If the light bulb really needed changing, market forces would have already caused it to happen.\nPersona: this is so me\nPersona: You know what makes me happy? That we are at the forefront of digital innovation. We are studying subject aimed exatcly at that, looking at jobs exatcly at that, trying out VR stuff, applying AI to everything we could leverage that on, coding in all the languages we come across and need to and searching for business opportunities combining all of those.\nPersona: And also building a netwotk that is into that as well\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\nFriend: I think if I keep working on it it's a bit inevitable for me to become the king of web stuff in your network :D\nPersona: In my network you are already the most agile all technical dude and also the most 'yes' person regarding daunting opportunities.\nPersona: You get enthusiastically interested in all of the cool topics\nPersona: lol I found this crazy book on headway that looks at sex from economic pov\nPersona: I took your idea about writing aplication to job with GPT\nPersona: GPT3 didn't work really well for me, but then chat gpt is helping out\nPersona: why google has those indians\nPersona: I am so racist holy shit\nPersona: but it sounds like a scam\nPersona: the whole presentation was boring though\nPersona: dissapointed in google\nFriend: how u not impressed of the tech\nPersona: Nothing beats chatgpt\nPersona: in that presentation\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: although could just manually place , and decapitalize W\nPersona: bruh my work is taking over my mind.

Also I guess the fact that I know her influences my perception\nFriend: Eastern European Corinne\nFriend: What is she working with\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: idk tbh\nPersona: she was just always hot for me\nPersona: What I call 'stupid hot bitches at CBS pretending to be smart'.

Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\nPersona: thats a CV\nPersona: You are hired!\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\nFriend: to help you get there?\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\nPersona: Need to fix that\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nFriend: exactly :D\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Basiscly with these building blocks I can build my trading/selling markerplace MVP\nPersona: I need online database, camera, push notif features and chat feature and MVP is good to go\nPersona: So after I finish this I will have to combine my knowledge and bake the MVP.\nFriend: nice\nFriend: good map\nPersona: I have some compliments for you\nPersona: ./vendor/ezyang/htmlpurifier/library/HTMLPurifier/Strategy/MakeWellFormed.php:                        // XXX fuckup\n./vendor/mofodojodino/profanity-filter/config/profanities.php:

Text below:\nConversations between persona and friends\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\nFriend: to help you get there?\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\nPersona: Need to fix that\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nFriend: exactly :D\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\nPersona: thats a CV\nPersona: You are hired!\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: The girls got 12s\nThey did real good\nZoe and Mada\nFriend: Ah like the dtu engineering one you sent me\n\nGood to figure out\nFriend: I think for cbs maybe the courses extra i took and grades played a role\n\nCause Elena applied but didnt get in\nFriend: And rn while u study you still have a chance to get extra course and pts in other uni maybe\nIf you need the pts or theyd like that\nFriend: Kinda\nBut will try to have a break like an adult\nActually get work done and not slack\n\nLooking at apartments for buying\n\nLearning rules and whatnot\n\nWill apply for rentals too\nFriend: I was at an apartment viewing with Laura today and will go next week to a mini house\nPersona: yeah for sure!\nPersona: lets book sauna\nPersona: somehow\nPersona: I had issues with that\nPersona: Edward, Patryk I know weren't that lucky\nPersona: DTU not gonna work. Can't meet requirements with CBS BSc\nPersona: Probably\nPersona: Moving in together? wowowowwo\nPersona: Random. What is your dream career role?\nFriend: Our typical place?\nFriend: Maybe!\nParents might help with down-payment for real place\n\nBut for now it's mostly informative \n\nHave to learn all things to look out for and get a feeling of what things are worth\nFriend: Dream?\nThe dream would be to be comfortable with my knowledge and able to work big projects\n\nRn i have very limited powers in IT\nFriend: The things maybe i gave you tips on\nI want to feel like that, but for bigger projects\nFriend: Hopefully i can grow in a company and get to a place like that\nPersona: yeah,  but I will try again\nPersona: good idea\nPersona: maybe you can message Marcus\nPersona: he has just baught an apartment\nFriend: Nice! He is danish too\nWill write him\nFriend: \"\nFeeling extreme cold from time to time (like we probably would in a natural habitat) significantly reduces inflammatory processes in the body. Therefore some diseases are treated this way already - like rheumatic inflammations of the joints - with very good results.\n\nAlso since cancer often starts with untreated inflammatory processes, exposing yourself to extreme cold from time to time could be a very good way to reduce your personal cancer risk.\n\nPlus: studies induce that it works with extreme heat as well.\"\nFriend: wonder what cancer rates of danes are\n\nsince they do cold and sauna\nFriend: The highest cancer rate for men and women combined was in Denmark at 334.9 people per 100,000.\n\nnvm xD\nFriend: can also be a function of testing.. not gonna make conclusions off of that\nPersona: do you like it?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\nFriend: nooo\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\nFriend: I love that clip\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\nFriend: other than Venus\nFriend: because that would suck\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\nPersona: you have good ideas\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I judge courses too much by the crowd\nPersona: like ITU really turned me off for some reason, althought I talked to very few. I visually judged lol. Thats bad\nPersona: this is CBS people\nPersona: fucking gorgeous, but evolutionary unfit\nFriend: ah yeah. maybe \na little more than 6 I think\n\ncause I didn't have full su first education\nFriend: I affirm\nFriend: but .. idk\n\nthere is a lot of that in life too\nPersona: of what?\nPersona: visual judging?\nPersona: or juding by crowd?\nFriend: both\n\nthink it's efficient to stick around ppl with looks\nFriend: just like in stock market because you assume market is efficient and someone else did the math, best to invest in whats going up\nFriend: xd idk that didnt make sense\nPersona: It made sense after I read it twice\nPersona: but it may not be because somebody did the math\nPersona: price went up. Somebody thought somebody did the math\nPersona: but nobody did the math\nFriend: exactly\nPersona: but so many people baught that the buying changed the math itself, so now the math is suddently good anyways\nPersona: time to write that personal statement. Fuck I hope I can go to sleep soon\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: omg its actually so sad\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: idk if thats true what they are saying\nFriend: hahah\nPersona: You would need some quantitative analysis to really understand the majority\nFriend: BP could never win\nFriend: majority of what?\nPersona: yeah its a pretty shitty situation they are in\nPersona: Like whats the majority opinion on the actual gulf heatlh\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: Idk if this is important, but I dont mention it. In the tweets I selected, they are not really admitting their guilt still. They say \"business is good, look at how good the local businesses are around where we operate\", they never mentioned that they have 'fixed' or 'cleaned' or that something has 'improved:\nFriend: still in the second period??\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: its the same in the ads\nPersona: they never show any admittance\nPersona: they just say that the situation is 'very good' as they claim\nPersona: They don't explicitly deny it tho\nPersona: I did the twitter post analysis you can see\nPersona: Now I will take the TV\nPersona: Yo, maybe I should come to your place now, we can look at the TV ads together if you want and maybe you have some questions about the tweets?\nFriend: i am home in an hour approx then you can come\nPersona: okay\nFriend: i will text you when i am home i am in the train\nPersona: okay no worries\nFriend: i am home\nPersona: Whats your address?\nFriend: Absalonsgade 43\nFriend: first floor on the right\nPersona: Alrigjt coming\nFriend: Hi can you define the two periods in your part\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So random, I will catch up on the rest of convo later (I got 2%)\nPersona: then you would be in danger of curing depression by drowing. I sense something sus here\nPersona: \"for safety reasons piwko is recomended\" I have the impression many polish people apply this as mantra to many situations\nPersona: I think jokes floating around in my lithuanian friend group distorted my understanding of autistic\nPersona: oh yeah, I flex everytime. When I am making coffee at work and choose between all the inclusive selection of milks, I must not take the lactose free one. I want my lactose. I always make sure I take one with lactose and I announce it verbally\nPersona: I just noticed the message didnt sent and my phone died yesterday \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I would not do this at 10 in the morning \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: atleast not so intensely animated\nFriend: excellent choice \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: oh no, bathtub is your idea. that's a you problem \ud83d\ude44\nFriend: my only battle is trying not to choke on beer\nFriend: speaking of Poland. I think your Pole magnet properties are at work again, because looks like a Polish lad is moving into my old room \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: at least I'm glad that all the new equipment I paid for is going to serve my nation\nFriend: oh yeah, fair enough. everyone uses this term very deliberately\nFriend: same with gaslightimg and narcissim. which drives me crazy\nFriend: yes, must maintain intense eye contact with coworkers while doing so\nPersona: oh wait, when you said the recipe for your recipe I never realized this challenge. You must look deadly funny drinking piwko lying flat on the ground. A true piwko akrobat\nPersona: recipe for your ritual*\nPersona: my best polish friend is leaving denmark for a long while or maybe forever today. The universe sends me a replacement. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be\nPersona: what is the correct meaning of narcissism then?\nPersona: and how do people use it wrong?\nPersona: force them to submission. milk tolerance dominance. everytime\nFriend: this is an extreme sport. when I was little my mum always told me not to drink while lying down bc apparently there is a story of a girl who did that once, choked and went into coma\nFriend: I'm so mad. I was waiting 2 years for fsb to give me my own polish person in the kitchen \ud83d\ude20\nFriend: idk people just tend to diagnose every person who wronged them with a mental illness\nPersona: my finding at 2 am today\nPersona: unrelated to anything\nPersona: (the video is the same, it just showed that it couldn't send, so I sent it again)\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: They neee to think ita serious\nPersona: problem that they may still choke and die from placebos, cause they would need to drink when lying\nFriend: what I get out of this is that the lack of snacks must've been a significant issue at Lithuanian parties once upon a time. you all are angry about that to this day\nFriend: soo in a perfect world you would like to test the impact of each factor, because you don't know if all are significant or not\nFriend: but as you can imagine cost wise and statistically it would really suck so no one does studies this complex\nFriend: what do you mean they need to think it's serious?! it is very serious\nFriend: I'm so happy to be quoting this legend\nPersona: I don't actually know why it says that, I just google the actual quote and its \"Ir a\u0161 ten buvau, al\u0173 mid\u0173 g\u0117riau, per barzd\u0105 varv\u0117jo, burnoj netur\u0117jau... \" It means \"And I have also been there, I have drunk beer and mead,  so much it was dripping through my beard, had nothing in my mouth...\"\nPersona: It was always a mystery to me, I always for some reason assumed that it was because the storyteller was just a peasant in the story and didn't get to eat, but I don't know if that makes sense, since drinks were probably more expensive. Or not? This is mostly medieval times\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\nPersona: I can be your test rat\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\nFriend: and we measure the difference\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\nFriend: who said that's desired?\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: We should do something crazy cool. Like bold, brave and public.\nPersona: My old ex friend did a travetron\nPersona: crazy dude he is, we used to do craziest shit\nPersona: traveltron is when you stream you travel, and get donations to travel more\nPersona: but you have to become an interesting persona and people pay cause they make you do stuff, can influence where you go\nPersona: and while you can hardly cheat interesting, but what many people don't have is the balls to do crazy shit\nPersona: I wonder if its possible to pull smth off like this during summer\nFriend: Hmmmm travelton you say? Never heard about it\nFriend: Could be hard to keep low attention spam beings to keep watching us, we would have to do crazy shit the whole time\nFriend: Xd\nFriend: But overall I'm always up for crazy shit so whenever I'm back in DK we can do some jackass staff xd\nFriend: hi bro\nPersona: Hi bro\nPersona: Will look\nFriend: thanks bro\nPersona: Try to be more conscise and less generic. Sometimes you are well conscise, but some sentences are bloated with sophisticated words that tell nothing. You are talking to IT, innovation people - they value consciseness. Especially the introduction and ending are written in a very different style from the rest of the text.\n\nAlso do some proofreading to try to improve the sentence structure and flow (perhaps a evening read with Kaja could work?), choose a consistency with capitalization.\n\nIn some sentences, you don't appear fully commited, I marked those. I think you should leave no doubts.\nPersona: it didn't work for me to leave comments in your doc\nPersona: so I made a copy\nFriend: Do I talk to IT people? I thought it's readed by admission people who doesn't know much about IT and they just try to find some key words xd\nPersona: Hm. Not 100% sure, but it would make sense that it is read by the head of studeis\nPersona: studies*\nPersona: or by people in that field at least\nPersona: But not sure\nFriend: yeah but those uncomitted were about BEIT, I think I show the comitment about IS\nPersona: It would be stupid if an application a subject is evaluated by people who have no understanding in the subject\nFriend: that's how most of the HR works xdd\nFriend: Thanks man it helps a lot, your feedback is as always profound and on place ;*\nFriend: on point*\nPersona: no problem man\nPersona: We will make it to our dream progams <3"

You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So random, I will catch up on the rest of convo later (I got 2%)\nPersona: then you would be in danger of curing depression by drowing.

I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\nFriend: i get this\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\nPersona: well almost applied\nPersona: I am confused. I have the legal right for Digital Business masters\nPersona: so what do I put in the personal statement field. Its required\nPersona: LOL shortest personal statement ever\nPersona: Whats your 2nd and 3rd prio?\nFriend: Do you need that\nFriend: No other prios\nPersona: straight to IS\nPersona: no othet option\nPersona: I like it\nPersona: sup my friend\nPersona: whar r u up to\nPersona: I woke up just now from a peaceful.sleel\nPersona: sleep*\nPersona: I cant cure the addiction to rimworld. I cant even search for it properly. The devs thought about it before hand by introducinh in-game addiction\nPersona: I have realized that I fall into the combined category of RimWorld, Minecraft and Factorio games\nPersona: gamers*\nPersona: cause many peoplr when talking about rimworld addiction refference mostky factorio\nPersona: and sometimes minecraft and oxygen not included\nFriend: yeah! Signed up for that through CBS\n\nare you going?\nFriend: was with Laura \nshe had bday\nPersona: I missed the good tickets\nPersona: so now its the 2hour ones lefy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: u can use many for free I saw\nPersona: Like mixtral is better than 3.5\nPersona: yeah in Pou\nPersona: Poe*\nPersona: they also have those\nPersona: but you can only dig deep and download locally\nPersona: I never did that\nPersona: check out the Huggingface leaderboard\nPersona: Better than gpt 3.5 turbo, but you need a lot of VRAM to run it\nPersona: but you can run it on a lower setting with a mid-end pc\nPersona: idk if that one support text and image at the same time, but I know there is atleast one which does, I can ask my friend if you want\nFriend: Ayyyy\nFriend: I have good procesor but not graphic card\nFriend: So I think I won't be able to run it :/\nFriend: So don't bother the friend\nPersona: m1 mac with 16gb apparently can\nPersona: damn what is happening to Arijan, he is going nuts on instagram, justifying putin\nPersona: its getting worse I feel\nPersona: I will ask my friend which model\nPersona: yeah that is a bit cringe, but I dont judge much by that - its harmless. The politics he is pushing makes me concerned. He is falling trap to many thinking fallacies and is clealy biast towards putin side, while claiming he is objective.\nPersona: That just makes me doubt whether I want to stay in connection with him\nFriend: Uuuu that's a hard statement\nFriend: I think he just want to show the other side of the medal In meantime being really controversional\nFriend: So he gets more reactions more likes etc\nFriend: And that may be the way to to achieve fame on social medias\nPersona: we all know that this is a shitty kind of reputation to achieve\nPersona: do you have a suit? I am contemplating whether I should buy one\nPersona: A good tailor fit suit will set me back 5000+ DKK in denmark\nFriend: I bought one in vietnam for 100USD with shirt all measurments, so maybe it would be cheaper for you to visit vietnam and buy suit there xddd\nFriend: in our eyes yes but imagine all the fans of Andrew Tate, they would die for him and that gives power\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Many people from CBS seem to like IS\nPersona: so I think its good for the CBS people\nFriend: my sample is infinitely worse\nn=0\nFriend: ah yeah. Make sense\nPersona: but I think I am smart also not in CBS ways, so I need to grow that\nPersona: I am interesting in improving my sample to I will let you know if we can talk to someone\nPersona: I will look through my network\nPersona: You already took Digital Business for the next semester, right?\nFriend: I will def probe how it is if I get into the digitalization one\nFriend: yeah! and I can apply until march I think for masters starting sept\nFriend: even if it's plain I'll maybe probe for what I think I went into it anyways. The people\nFriend: see if they have connections and shit and if I can make some with them\n\notherwise idk if worth\nPersona: My two colleagues, Vilma and Aske are studying Digitalization masters at CBS now\nPersona: The fact that I will have to be put with different breed like Vilma together into same course keeps me away from it.\nFriend: nice!\n\nI think for cbs students they have a bit different curriculum also. Cause you studied some stuff in bachelors so it should be better\nPersona: I want to experience the deep, antisocial breed of computer scientists, so I can learn their language, norms and signals to explot their skill well later in business and also learn to do the heavy-lifting myself when needed\nFriend: can't help but imagine this when you speak about the antisocial breed of comp sci\nPersona: what was your thesis topic?\nPersona: :DDDDD\nFriend: :( i dont really know\n\nsome stuff I wrote with Corinne about her company:\n\nExploring Business Processes and\nData-Driven Strategies in Outsourced\nMarketing and Outbound Sales\n(with VAEKST)\nPersona: xddd you dont know?\nPersona: \"Data-Driven Strategies in Outsourced\nMarketing and Outbound Sales\" sounds good\nFriend: ppl making errors in entering data at her company\n\nso 2 options, better process and teaching ppl or automate the shit and don't bother with ppl\nPersona: nice tldr\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\nFriend: Can u tell me online?\nFriend: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\nFriend: Finished rony's mail\nFriend: Gave input on Rob's\nFriend: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\nFriend: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\nFriend: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\nFriend: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\nFriend: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\nFriend: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\nFriend: How r u holding up?:)\nPersona: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\nPersona: eating lunch now\nPersona: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\nPersona: touched*\nPersona: So I will get back to you in a bit\nFriend: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\nFriend: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\nPersona: I'll show you next time we meet\nPersona: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\nPersona: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\nPersona: Send the same one twice\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\nPersona: lets try it\nFriend: Nice\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: out of all\nPersona: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\nPersona: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\nPersona: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\nFriend: Will do now\nFriend: U didn't check Rony's mail?\nFriend: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\nFriend: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\nFriend: What is that 1 called?\nFriend: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\nFriend: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\nFriend: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\nPersona: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\nPersona: see*\nFriend: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\nPersona: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\nPersona: and fully through DIGI\nPersona: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\nPersona: no need, I give you a summary\nPersona: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\nPersona: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\nFriend: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\nFriend: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\nPersona: but do we really need more than already mapped?\nPersona: Did we send massages to them\nPersona: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\nPersona: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\nFriend: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\nFriend: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\nFriend: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Apprently you can create a git repository in a Google Drive folder\nPersona: But\nPersona: since I like to learn stuff, I will find a workaround\nPersona: I will do the script later, I got a little bit annoyed while bulding it\nPersona: For now I will manually move items to it from time to time\nFriend: Ill be at DS 12 w/ u\nPersona: alright\nPersona: wya?\nPersona: oh fuck\nPersona: I am.in wronf one\nFriend: 2.08 In 1 sec\nPersona: btw in case you missed it, I shared the cases with you on a G drive invite\nPersona: The first case is super cool tho\nFriend: I saw thx\nFriend: Just finished it. It sure sounds like an interesting org 2 work in!\nFriend: I\u2019ll sit by the left side\nFriend: Plz bring a charger\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nPersona: Hey, I have been looking (a abit today, felt a bit bad) into the market research methods, also specifically into few, but will look more into it. I think focus groups is a solid choice but I already found some alternatives, and maybe there can be more.\nPersona: Its still WIP, but see some of the methodologies I mapped in my notes (linked to the For Elias) part\nPersona: I pushed to repo\nPersona: Hey, I'll skip the class today, cause I am a little sick\nFriend: I'll check it out. I've been thinking a lot about how we will present a certain product 2 the digital personas, and I feel like it's going to be challenging 2 not embed bias. Do u have any idea about that?\nFriend: Why is it it's called WIP?\nFriend: I'll share my notes. Hope u feel better soon!<3\nFriend: git config --global alias.cp '!git add . && git commit -m \"Quick update\" && git push'\nFriend: git config --global alias.up 'pull origin main'\nFriend: Here is 2 alias scripts. Put them into your terminal. So u from now on only need 2 \"cd\" into your local version of the repo, and then write \"git cp\" to share yours, and \"git up\" to get mine;)\nPersona: well, a persona must be biast by definition I would assume\nPersona: if you are 0 biast, then you are just a general person, not really a persona\nPersona: Or what kind of bias did you mean?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: They neee to think ita serious\nPersona: problem that they may still choke and die from placebos, cause they would need to drink when lying\nFriend: what I get out of this is that the lack of snacks must've been a significant issue at Lithuanian parties once upon a time. you all are angry about that to this day\nFriend: soo in a perfect world you would like to test the impact of each factor, because you don't know if all are significant or not\nFriend: but as you can imagine cost wise and statistically it would really suck so no one does studies this complex\nFriend: what do you mean they need to think it's serious?! it is very serious\nFriend: I'm so happy to be quoting this legend\nPersona: I don't actually know why it says that, I just google the actual quote and its \"Ir a\u0161 ten buvau, al\u0173 mid\u0173 g\u0117riau, per barzd\u0105 varv\u0117jo, burnoj netur\u0117jau... \" It means \"And I have also been there, I have drunk beer and mead,  so much it was dripping through my beard, had nothing in my mouth...\"\nPersona: It was always a mystery to me, I always for some reason assumed that it was because the storyteller was just a peasant in the story and didn't get to eat, but I don't know if that makes sense, since drinks were probably more expensive. Or not? This is mostly medieval times\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\nPersona: I can be your test rat\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\nFriend: and we measure the difference\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\nFriend: who said that's desired?\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose"

Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah I think divinity, power, confidence arouses me\nPersona: but divinity would be a kink (if there is one) that is like never achievable. Same with anime porn (forgot how its called)\nPersona: hentai!\nPersona: would have to wait 100 years until they make a full dive simulation experience and satisfy my divine needs\nPersona: Greek times must have been fun, they believed they were real, they had a dream. I am sure they jerked off to the marble sculptures\nPersona: Look at this mood\nPersona: the view through window is picturesque\nFriend: Daamn\nFriend: I see the beauty now of seeing far\nFriend: Im not complaining but prefer yours atm\nPersona: nice wallpaper xd\nPersona: My dream view is to live high up and have a view on an open busy street. That gives me this hard to describle economic feeling\nPersona: The feeling that economic action is happening, supply and demand is meeting, decimal points are changing\nPersona: Locality? whats tht\nFriend: daamn\nFriend: i guess hq\nPersona: :DDDD\nPersona: :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\nPersona: nice\nPersona: I was using ChatGPT for help with flutter and it understood most of the questions really well until I got to this. It gave me a properpy reference of a default Flutter libary object that does not exist. I searched in google for any references to this property, but nobody ever mentioned it.\nPersona: Then when I asked him if he was sure, he responded with this xdddd\nPersona: \"I don't have an apple, but instead I have an apple\"\nFriend: Wth\nFriend: Well i hope it works good cause tomorrow i got exam\nPersona: :Ddd\nPersona: Good luck\nPersona: this is perfect\nPersona: my slave OpenAI\nFriend: god damn\nFriend: those are some good question followings to get a linkedin response\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I biked 30 min home\nPersona: 2 hours before each rimworld game is modding\nPersona: And I love this modding community\nPersona: I am currently running ~100 mods\nPersona: and its lighly modded in a way\nPersona: most of the mods are quality of life\nPersona: 1 mod is a complete overhaul, maybe 10 - 15 major content mods\nPersona: and another 10 - 20 minor content mods\nPersona: rest quality of life\nPersona: I don't even know whats vanilla tbh\nPersona: I have to use an external Rimworld mod manager with python\nFriend: :DD\nPersona: Rimworld is so nice\nPersona: So additing\nPersona: I dont need life goals. I can have goals in rimworld and live with that\nPersona: I had a pretty good gamd yesterday. I been trying to play naked brutality with almost harderst difficulty, hardcire combat overhaul mod and perdeath\nPersona: I got pretty far, mode than usual. Usually, I survive around a year and my colony dies, but always in some different ways\nPersona: Hey mate, patryk, antoni and I are going to try cs2 today\nPersona: do you want to join?\nFriend: Yess\nFriend: Getting it now\nPersona: \ud83e\udd29\nFriend: a bit slow tho\nPersona: same\nPersona: I started 18o clock is still going\nPersona: its*\nPersona: how much left?\nFriend: 50\nPersona: wanna hop on dc?\nFriend: WomboCombo#4163\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so you would have to resort to melee combat, animal etc to fight for you I guess. Or build turrets\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute. If they unfreeeze for a while, say a raid penetrates your base or a unaticipated heatwave heats it up, you will get poluttion in your map and it could be a lot you will need hazmat gear to just survive and clean it up.\nPersona: you could send the pollutioj away via transport pods to your enemies tho\nPersona: that will make them real angry and they will send raids to you\nPersona: there are also sangophuages - pretty much vampires that can live forever but have to drink blood - can be harvested regularly from prisoners\nPersona: There is also luciferium, a drug I never dares to take. It makea you instantly addicted to it and then if you dont consume it regularly, you will die. However it could overtime heal up otherwise unhealable injury, including permanent ones.\nPersona: insane\nFriend: sounds like a good last resort for units that are low\nFriend: can you not stack it up so you have for that unit for a while_\nFriend: and are there some ways that unit can be of good value thanks to that unique circumstance?\n\nLike if it will die anyway, good for recon operation maybe or something where death is high chance\n\nor maybe it can pass on knowledge or something\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: You can get a shot in the head and suffer from a permanent brain injury of some type\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\nPersona: like bad back or frail\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\nPersona: and yea you can stack\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ty for coding task\nFriend: deseperate for fun :D\nPersona: I fifuted ir ojr\nPersona: Fuck\nPersona: I wish I saw ur msg eaelier\nPersona: I fixed ir now xd\nPersona: we double solved ir\nPersona: lel\nPersona: it*\nPersona: Xdd yeah its another prob\nFriend: wdmy another :o\nPersona: like the cookie prompt\nPersona: But thank you for the help m8\nFriend: No worries\nI love those kinds of bugs\nPersona: you love bugs.

So for me fight support is win-win.\nPersona: There is also 1K fund in lithuania that's popular\nPersona: But they donate for similar stuff than blye-yellow\nFriend: what a logo\nPersona: yah xdd\nPersona: I think I should donate today aswell haha\nPersona: I'll do 1k fund, never done through that actually\nPersona: you can donate with revolut I see\nPersona: (of course you can cause Revolut a Lithuanian bank xdd)\nFriend: hate corporations \nhate everything today\nFriend: all companies gay logo\nFriend: where is ukraine logo_\nPersona: Xdddd\nPersona: go to russia or saudi arabia lol\nPersona: they dont have\nFriend: yeah and they have black\nFriend: i have seen\nFriend: fuck all\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: lol\nPersona: I wonder did Lt companies do gay logo.

My hands are starting to mess up at keyboard shortcuts.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: But then also by doing that I will ground myself more to nolifer life (lol wtf nice oxymoron), while instead I been trying to go out more.\nPersona: But then damn, a good pc is like my deepest heart desire and also childhood trauma. Since games good better, I couldnt play any new ones. The last title I could play with maybe 50fps was GTA IV\nPersona: and that was even laggy\nPersona: COD MW3 (the old one), Advanced warfare, none ran well. Lowest settings were lagging.\nPersona: GTA V runs after its been ultra optimized by devs, but low graphics too\nPersona: Some games like Squad are too laggy to enjoy\nPersona: Cyberpunk - didnt even dare to try\nPersona: PCVR prob wont even run\nPersona: My brother got a decent gaming pc, I remember I was feeling incredible happt seeing high graphics with no lag. It was magical\nPersona: so yeah\nPersona: idk, is this happiness worth the risk of falling into nolifer hole\nPersona: So little of my friends play pc games these days\nPersona: wtf this is so sad\nPersona: Life is no longer fun because we have real goals now? wtf\nPersona: life as a kid was more meaningful\nPersona: now its a lot of pretending\nPersona: wtf is this lie\nPersona: it feels like a dillema\nFriend: also would you be up for car loaning?\nPersona: Im down\nPersona: what do you mean?\nFriend: To help Nathalie with moving dog\nFriend: Also I kind of wanted before to rent for dating a car sometimes\nFriend: Can go to nice places or pick up the girl\nFriend: This would be thursday if possible\nPersona: yeah sure man\nPersona: just let me know\nPersona: sure\nPersona: You can pick it up today anytime or Thursday anytime.

I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\nFriend: nooo\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\nFriend: I love that clip\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\nFriend: other than Venus\nFriend: because that would suck\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\nPersona: you have good ideas\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: MVC\n\nModel view controller\n\nBackend \nFrontend\nBackend\n\nXD \nIm confused if they look for a fullstacker and not a frontender\nFriend: But they do put some really hardcore frontend stuff like A11y, SSR  \nAnd then they ask a bunch of backend shit or cms stuff\nFriend: Wtf is happening outside atm\nPersona: bro I drove with car this morning at 8\nPersona: crazy\nPersona: Sllid once a bit just to test the waters\nFriend: Wowow\nFriend: Nice?\nPersona: was a bit scary at firat\nPersona: firat\nPersona: first\nPersona: especially since the breaks were a bit sus\nPersona: but then I think it was the ABS kicking in\nFriend: Yeah abs annoying for drift\nThats why you use handbreak xD\nPersona: Idk, but it protect me from unintentional drift xd\nFriend: Abs good\nI tested abs on thebike tosay\nPersona: do you even need pedal brake for drift?\nPersona: it exists?\nFriend: Lot of snow in the backalley and when i go fast i pretend to break with abs\nPersona: xdddddd\nFriend: Yeah just push break til wheel locks, release\nAnd do that fast\nFriend: Pedal breaks\nPersona: yeah nice\nFriend: Basically put pressure/weight on the leg pressing and release\nBit like jumping on one leg\nFriend: Not great for drift but good stability\nPersona: oh you break witg legs\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: forgot\nPersona: but bike is not that damgerous antways.

I think focus groups is a solid choice but I already found some alternatives, and maybe there can be more.\nPersona: Its still WIP, but see some of the methodologies I mapped in my notes (linked to the For Elias) part\nPersona: I pushed to repo\nPersona: Hey, I'll skip the class today, cause I am a little sick\nFriend: I'll check it out. I've been thinking a lot about how we will present a certain product 2 the digital personas, and I feel like it's going to be challenging 2 not embed bias. Do u have any idea about that?\nFriend: Why is it it's called WIP?\nFriend: I'll share my notes.

In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\nPersona: I'll show you next time we meet\nPersona: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\nPersona: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\nPersona: Send the same one twice\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\nPersona: lets try it\nFriend: Nice\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I am going to invite anyone else myself, but if you want to, go ahead, given that you would be the one doing the extra trip xdd\nFriend: Maybe too much\nPersona: i am.not going*\nFriend: I dont have anyone else i want\nFriend: Do you have a thing for trailer\nPersona: I meab driving the 2nd trip\nFriend: \u0422\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0447\nFriend: Then ez to fit sleep eq\nPersona: how it looks?\nPersona: ask for his fb?\nPersona: who is this caveman, even boomers have fb\nPersona: what about his gf, laura?\nPersona: she also off the grid?\nPersona: I dont think so actually\nFriend: His gf no come\nMy gf u mean?\nPersona: oh so we are 4?\nFriend: Not gf yet\nPersona: then its good\nPersona: extra space\nFriend: You me sam arijan?\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: Laura\nFriend: 5\nPersona: who is laura?\nPersona: I tought its sam gf\nFriend: No x___x\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: oh\nFriend: Ive been going out with her a little while\nPersona: its your hookup?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: The girls got 12s\nThey did real good\nZoe and Mada\nFriend: Ah like the dtu engineering one you sent me\n\nGood to figure out\nFriend: I think for cbs maybe the courses extra i took and grades played a role\n\nCause Elena applied but didnt get in\nFriend: And rn while u study you still have a chance to get extra course and pts in other uni maybe\nIf you need the pts or theyd like that\nFriend: Kinda\nBut will try to have a break like an adult\nActually get work done and not slack\n\nLooking at apartments for buying\n\nLearning rules and whatnot\n\nWill apply for rentals too\nFriend: I was at an apartment viewing with Laura today and will go next week to a mini house\nPersona: yeah for sure!\nPersona: lets book sauna\nPersona: somehow\nPersona: I had issues with that\nPersona: Edward, Patryk I know weren't that lucky\nPersona: DTU not gonna work.

He is danish too\nWill write him\nFriend: \"\nFeeling extreme cold from time to time (like we probably would in a natural habitat) significantly reduces inflammatory processes in the body. Therefore some diseases are treated this way already - like rheumatic inflammations of the joints - with very good results.\n\nAlso since cancer often starts with untreated inflammatory processes, exposing yourself to extreme cold from time to time could be a very good way to reduce your personal cancer risk.\n\nPlus: studies induce that it works with extreme heat as well.\"\nFriend: wonder what cancer rates of danes are\n\nsince they do cold and sauna\nFriend: The highest cancer rate for men and women combined was in Denmark at 334.9 people per 100,000.\n\nnvm xD\nFriend: can also be a function of testing.. not gonna make conclusions off of that\nPersona: do you like it?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: wait that was ambiguous, I have stuff I need to do on these days. other than that I should be free\nPersona: I am pretty sure I can adapt to be free most of these days\nPersona: would be ideal so somehow induce the same 3 AM conversation type, preferably ealier haha\nPersona: maybe 23rd\nPersona: ohh\nPersona: Even tho I read this, my brain disregarded it \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: you are busy every single weekend. Damn you must going out a lot\nPersona: I wanted to sneak into ITU scroll bar for a while - they state they only allow itu students. I think they are only available on fridays though\nPersona: what are the things you wanted to do for a while, that can be doable together?\nPersona: cause all I can think is stupid or kinda lame \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Ahhh so close, I will try to apply again in some other extraordinary method\nFriend: I see that we're equally skilled at reading comprehension \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: what, you've found another 5 disorders you think you have and you need me to tell you that you don't?\nFriend: not really, but I work both days until ~17, and since it's a people job, there's about 50% chance that I'll be an asshole by the end of the day depending on how busy it is\nFriend: so if I do make plans, it's the ones that I can bail on without disrupting the whole activity\nFriend: you are really passionate about that nerd hunting\nFriend: what's there. I know nothing about itu\nFriend: hm I don't know. I'd have to think about it\nPersona: reading comprehension xddd\nPersona: cracked me up\nPersona: yeah, precisely\nPersona: or just\nPersona: you are very unique to talk to\nPersona: ah. But also I can handle asshole. As you would assume, I have to deal with 100 of them at school everyday anyways.\nPersona: where do you work?\nPersona: oh you would not imagine\nPersona: I am going to ITU tommorow at 16 with my classmate for open days\nPersona: Plan is to scout masters programs, but most importantly, tame some nerds, so they can bring us to the scroll bar - the nerd hive.\nPersona: Because the Scroll bar instagram staff got passive aggresssive in terms of answering to my requests to come on some friday. I asked a couple of times and instead of replying they posted this\nPersona: I was thinking of a few options to comment\na) I don't have any friends from ITU. can I register myself?\nb) I dare myself to ask a random student in the campus to sign me up. Can I get a free beer then?\nc)  deadlock exception, since my ITU friend count is 0 and can't instantiate any without connecting to scroll bar ITU friend factory. Pls patch, thx.\nf) can somebody pls sign me up? I will buy you 10 beers (the number may or may not be expressed in binary, I am not sure yet)\n\nbut I will not comment anything, may our minds be entertained by the fictitious conversations each of the options would have created\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I can be your dummy interviewer. We an do multiple iterations and in between each iteration we chug one additional piwko. You have to train yourself to function in an interview at all brain capacity levels.\nPersona: Its called \"The piwko cognitive flexibility extension method\"\nPersona: and today, at KU bar, is the perfect place for that\nFriend: nonono\nFriend: I'm trying to be responsible over here\nFriend: go away\nPersona: ey its next friday, the outcome of this evening is literally of least significance'\nFriend: we can go after that to see how piwko's efficacy is affected by addition of happy or sad tears (depending on the results)\nPersona: okay, but woundn't we also need a control run, which could be today?\nPersona: but also, congrats on getting the interview \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: I guess I'll have to take a week long break from trying to exterminate 1/3 of humanity\nFriend: you can also use this opportunity to recruit some nerdy semisocial losers at KU\nFriend: thank you!\nPersona: Okay, fair enough, 100% dedication to the upcoming interview, despite my sophisticated manipulation techniques. I respect that\nPersona: Will do!\nPersona: (and I will reply to the ongoing thread a bit later)\nFriend: oh you don't have to. not much important going in there. have fun!!\nPersona: I'll come in with some new inspirations\nPersona: from KU experience\nFriend: and what are the news from the front? did you survive? \ud83d\udc40\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: environment hostility wise, woundnt all other planets suck?\nPersona: or Venus is somehow extra naughty?\nPersona: okay you are right, I would not be drinking then. I could be sipping non alcoholic pina colada or cola maybe\nPersona: so you only talk to me as a manager? \ud83d\ude22 Should I start looking for a luxury rooftop hot tub and start crying about my loneliness already?\nPersona: Sometimes I forget you are polish\nPersona: you seem to cocealing your inner polish quite well\nPersona: to be*\nPersona: I tried this btw. I think it might be working\nFriend: full 3 min version? because this is gold, you're missing out otherwise \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: oof, no, this is tricky socially. I don't know if there's a way out of this other than somewhat concerned 'oh okay'\nFriend: or deflect with a question\nFriend: I mean, as much as neurodivergence is celebrated these days, I'm sure every parents wants nothing more than for their kid to be healthy and have a life as easy as possible which is not exactly the case here\nFriend: it is. it's referred to as hell planet for a reason. that's not the right vibe\nFriend: milk! like a psychopath\nFriend: yeah no, you just don't know me very well haha\nFriend: I'm proud :')\nFriend: oh look. now you can cry whenever and wherever you want!\nPersona: Shampoo, bathtub and a sponge. Thats a whole depression cure kit \ud83d\ude31\nFriend: but no Pitbull :/\nPersona: How flat do you need to be on the ground for your famous depression repelling ritual, and is pivko neccessary?\nPersona: I am afraid lack of Pitbull might not be the only issue here\nPersona: I think so, I will see again\nPersona: ok I didnt before xddd\nPersona: but now I did xd\nPersona: I cant believe this is real autism. It cant be that bad come on\nPersona: With some spacer level advanced life support a hell environment would be THE vibe. You there crying in your nanotech-anti-gravity-force-field suit, while an apocalypse is raging outside. A perfect contrast, or perhaps a perfect reflection\nPersona: I need to do this sometime as a social experiment\nPersona: during a night out, pull out some a milk bottle, pour it in the glass, drink it and say no word\nPersona: (without polish hazelnut vodka)\nPersona: I must meet a polish Joanna\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: we go by car and we to to Ramen to Biru\nPersona: no, we have to pay xd\nPersona: I just want Ramen\nPersona: tough day\nFriend: Ok\nFriend: Im tdy\nFriend: Rdy\nFriend: But\nFriend: Im not sure i dhould spend food tiday\nPersona: come to Volunteer hub\nPersona: Date went smooth, but idk if I like her enough\nPersona: I really thought it will be harder to get her and that annoys me\nPersona: and I didnt expect her to be so shy in her manners, like I can see a clearn lack of confidence, atleast near me\nFriend: Man....\n XD i won't be able to understand fully why shy is bad for you\nI have different mindset\nPersona: got a danske bank acc\nPersona: we gotta talk about girls today\nFriend: Here?\nFriend: I have 30 Mik left\nFriend: Min\nPersona: Green tent\nPersona: whaaaaays up\nPersona: wya?\nFriend: Selling\nFriend: Tent\nFriend: Catering\nFriend: Sandwiches\nPersona: u still on shift?\nPersona: okay\nPersona: I will come\nPersona: there are many tents"

What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I also am depending on the circumstances\nFriend: yeah I guess but\nPersona: pure autism\nFriend: lol\nPersona: like give me an situation in which you feel that you might be weird or autistic?\nFriend: yeah socially I've been avoiding people and really anxious about social situations\n\nand when I've looked for contact, people have been weirded out\nFriend: so the question is if I was poorly socialized so I did weird stuff or was just bit of autist\nPersona: What did you do before you went to KEA first time?\nPersona: I was also very anxious and avoided people when I used to play too much video games\nPersona: I had this period in my middle school\nPersona: If I felt the same way right now as an adult, I might feel like smth wrong or I am weird\nFriend: There is the thing that autism is harder to detect in adults because when you grow you kind of learn to act normal\nPersona: but what do you people when you look for contact, people are weirded out? Like these days, right now? Is it only about girls or including boys?\nPersona: then so many of us may have autism and we are just pretending to act normal lol\nPersona: Cause honestly, I do act a lot of stuff to reach my goals or make an impression to some person\nPersona: Maybe I am also an autist then\nPersona: I don't really know, I think I know too little about it.\nPersona: for me the better understanding is the word 'weird'\nFriend: yeah \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nthe thing that prompted me to be curious now is the 5 love languages\nFriend: have you heard of that thing\nPersona: is it like words, touch, and some 3 more?\nFriend: yee ye!\nFriend: but then there are these 5 others and I'm questioning if those 5 others are the ones for autists\nFriend: or if normal people can also identify with them\nPersona: 5 others. Like 5 love languages for autists?\nFriend: ye :DD\nFriend: you remember I keep asking to meet and just study together or do our thing but separately\nFriend: the exact thing is stated as one of them\nFriend: idk.. would have to test on people if they identify with any of these to see\nPersona: But why?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\nFriend: to help you get there?\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\nPersona: Need to fix that\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nFriend: exactly :D\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: The girls got 12s\nThey did real good\nZoe and Mada\nFriend: Ah like the dtu engineering one you sent me\n\nGood to figure out\nFriend: I think for cbs maybe the courses extra i took and grades played a role\n\nCause Elena applied but didnt get in\nFriend: And rn while u study you still have a chance to get extra course and pts in other uni maybe\nIf you need the pts or theyd like that\nFriend: Kinda\nBut will try to have a break like an adult\nActually get work done and not slack\n\nLooking at apartments for buying\n\nLearning rules and whatnot\n\nWill apply for rentals too\nFriend: I was at an apartment viewing with Laura today and will go next week to a mini house\nPersona: yeah for sure!\nPersona: lets book sauna\nPersona: somehow\nPersona: I had issues with that\nPersona: Edward, Patryk I know weren't that lucky\nPersona: DTU not gonna work. Can't meet requirements with CBS BSc\nPersona: Probably\nPersona: Moving in together? wowowowwo\nPersona: Random. What is your dream career role?\nFriend: Our typical place?\nFriend: Maybe!\nParents might help with down-payment for real place\n\nBut for now it's mostly informative \n\nHave to learn all things to look out for and get a feeling of what things are worth\nFriend: Dream?\nThe dream would be to be comfortable with my knowledge and able to work big projects\n\nRn i have very limited powers in IT\nFriend: The things maybe i gave you tips on\nI want to feel like that, but for bigger projects\nFriend: Hopefully i can grow in a company and get to a place like that\nPersona: yeah,  but I will try again\nPersona: good idea\nPersona: maybe you can message Marcus\nPersona: he has just baught an apartment\nFriend: Nice! He is danish too\nWill write him\nFriend: \"\nFeeling extreme cold from time to time (like we probably would in a natural habitat) significantly reduces inflammatory processes in the body. Therefore some diseases are treated this way already - like rheumatic inflammations of the joints - with very good results.\n\nAlso since cancer often starts with untreated inflammatory processes, exposing yourself to extreme cold from time to time could be a very good way to reduce your personal cancer risk.\n\nPlus: studies induce that it works with extreme heat as well.\"\nFriend: wonder what cancer rates of danes are\n\nsince they do cold and sauna\nFriend: The highest cancer rate for men and women combined was in Denmark at 334.9 people per 100,000.\n\nnvm xD\nFriend: can also be a function of testing.. not gonna make conclusions off of that\nPersona: do you like it?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore.

I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not.

I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not.

I was waiting 2 years for fsb to give me my own polish person in the kitchen \ud83d\ude20\nFriend: idk people just tend to diagnose every person who wronged them with a mental illness\nPersona: my finding at 2 am today\nPersona: unrelated to anything\nPersona: (the video is the same, it just showed that it couldn't send, so I sent it again)\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\nPersona: they well pranked you there\nPersona: Are you also going to the queens riterement like everyone else seems to?\nFriend: hahah wait til you spot one of these bad boys in the wild. it's going to blow your mind\nFriend: TIL that's it's surprisingly difficult to find a good picture of a truck on the internet\nFriend: but I'm doing that for the benefit of humanity. am I a hero yet?\nFriend: noo I was at work all day. don't even know what I've missed. did they go out to wave or what?\nPersona: you mean a truck \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I saw a truck\nPersona: I was so surprised of this car because its like a personal daily vehicle of this size\nPersona: thats whay they have in US\nPersona: US vs EU top selling car\nPersona: but what is the benefit?\nFriend: I know, I know. I'm just teasing you\nFriend: had no idea, but yup, sounds about American\nFriend: you can look at this from 2 perspectives: 1) I'm working on a therapy aimed to help people suffering from severe cases of dead social battery; 2) currently I'm protecting people from the grumpiness induced by my own severe case of dead social battery\nFriend: thank you. that was a perfect field report\nFriend: I accept it as the official version of historical events and refuse to listen to or read anything else about it\nFriend: oh wow. that's really a lot of people\nFriend: aw they're so cute with their little flags\nPersona: its perfect for americans, think about it - you can fit a family of 5 highly overweight persons and at the same time mount a 50cal in the back in case of property defence situation or just for fun.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\nFriend: to help you get there?\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\nPersona: Need to fix that\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nFriend: exactly :D\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: lol\nPersona: thats overthinking at its finest\nFriend: Cause maybe i am and colleagues pitty me and give me a win for the competition\nFriend: I did the math. Its more likely\nPersona: this is a reddit post. \n\nI though I am retarded because I guessed a 1/400 random number\nPersona: oh\nPersona: in that way\nPersona: but why out of pity?\nFriend: Wanna bike the holiday?\nIm taking the dino for a ride maybe\nFriend: Cause im retarded\nFriend: M3 line has a QR code hunt\nAnd then you get free choco bunny and a chance to win some museum tickets\nPersona: wait I am in shower xd\nPersona: okay, but i dont think you are retarded\nPersona: at most you are a little bit childish, but I dont think colleagues would mind that\nPersona: I am in portugal man\nPersona: or what day you are talking about?\nFriend: You're where :o\nFriend: Good to hear xD cause that gif is how ive been feeling today\nFriend: Friday saturday sunday monday \nWhatever\nFriend: They have it to monday including\nPersona: yeah bro, I am on a cbs surf trip \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I am back on Monday\nFriend: Holy moly nice\nAnd short sleeve?

I'll see you when you're back then\nFriend: That sand loooks goood\nFriend: Wanna step bare feet\nLooks soft\nPersona: yeah today is good\nPersona: sometimes a bit windy\nPersona: 17-23 at the hot time of day\nFriend: did you see this\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I want it in me\nPersona: torrent system is cockblocking my seed \ud83d\ude2a\nFriend: Xdddd\nPersona: maybe try to reannounce but idk how it works\nFriend: Don't know either\nPersona: I have 3Mb/ps upload speed, you should be done in no time with my seed\nPersona: i disabled some limit\nPersona: but still, cant connect to you \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: I have only one guy from Norway\nPersona: eduroam xddddddddddd\nPersona: dude setup a distribution at a school\nFriend: 10X mindset\nFriend: clearly\nPersona: its easy VPN, all the fines go to school\nPersona: i enjoy it\nFriend: woow I haven't been hyped for anything like for this gadget\nPersona: omg bro I loved your conversation with Kaja \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude0d\nPersona: so funny\nPersona: I am laughing so hard\nPersona: But damn we notice different things. Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating. Oops maybe I am not so faithfull\nPersona: Say sorry to Kaja for having to endure watching the cheating xd\nPersona: Xdd I a listening again, this is so good\nPersona: I watched the video, but I have to think about it \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: What do you like so much about it? The display and placement?\nFriend: that's a vaild point, in europe we are so free that we don't care about consequences of our deeds xdd\nFriend: Minimalism, no advertisments, just pure extension of my brain which can improve my productivity without getting me into some mindless scrolling of instagram or fb. And the rapid way you can access the knowledge also sounds like a huge pros\nFriend: beside that if my friends would use it I wouldnt have so much comfort as it feels like you are interrogated xdd\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I judge courses too much by the crowd\nPersona: like ITU really turned me off for some reason, althought I talked to very few. I visually judged lol. Thats bad\nPersona: this is CBS people\nPersona: fucking gorgeous, but evolutionary unfit\nFriend: ah yeah. maybe \na little more than 6 I think\n\ncause I didn't have full su first education\nFriend: I affirm\nFriend: but .. idk\n\nthere is a lot of that in life too\nPersona: of what?\nPersona: visual judging?\nPersona: or juding by crowd?\nFriend: both\n\nthink it's efficient to stick around ppl with looks\nFriend: just like in stock market because you assume market is efficient and someone else did the math, best to invest in whats going up\nFriend: xd idk that didnt make sense\nPersona: It made sense after I read it twice\nPersona: but it may not be because somebody did the math\nPersona: price went up.

Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: We should do something crazy cool. Like bold, brave and public.\nPersona: My old ex friend did a travetron\nPersona: crazy dude he is, we used to do craziest shit\nPersona: traveltron is when you stream you travel, and get donations to travel more\nPersona: but you have to become an interesting persona and people pay cause they make you do stuff, can influence where you go\nPersona: and while you can hardly cheat interesting, but what many people don't have is the balls to do crazy shit\nPersona: I wonder if its possible to pull smth off like this during summer\nFriend: Hmmmm travelton you say? Never heard about it\nFriend: Could be hard to keep low attention spam beings to keep watching us, we would have to do crazy shit the whole time\nFriend: Xd\nFriend: But overall I'm always up for crazy shit so whenever I'm back in DK we can do some jackass staff xd\nFriend: hi bro\nPersona: Hi bro\nPersona: Will look\nFriend: thanks bro\nPersona: Try to be more conscise and less generic. Sometimes you are well conscise, but some sentences are bloated with sophisticated words that tell nothing. You are talking to IT, innovation people - they value consciseness. Especially the introduction and ending are written in a very different style from the rest of the text.\n\nAlso do some proofreading to try to improve the sentence structure and flow (perhaps a evening read with Kaja could work?), choose a consistency with capitalization.\n\nIn some sentences, you don't appear fully commited, I marked those. I think you should leave no doubts.\nPersona: it didn't work for me to leave comments in your doc\nPersona: so I made a copy\nFriend: Do I talk to IT people? I thought it's readed by admission people who doesn't know much about IT and they just try to find some key words xd\nPersona: Hm.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done. Its a little science.\nPersona: Fuck I wish I had all the time in the world\nFriend: what needs to be done\nPersona: wow wsb is working\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm having huge confirmation bias now because I see it the same way\nFriend: don't know a girl that I can get an opinion from that I can trust with taht\nPersona: Maybe because we see women in similar way. But ask someone else too if you need more thoughts\nPersona: hmmm. Maybe Luiza?\nFriend: need to be super careful with analyzing her answer because she is always positive :DD\nPersona: or idk maybe even go with the flow, keep looking for other girls. I mean if you need so much of opinions what do others think about it, then maybe you are just forcing yourself to like her. When you actually like/love a girl, it shows clearly.\nFriend: I wonder how her brother would think because he was very religious and has a pure take sometimes\n\nbut honestly don't really want to know.

Just abusing google calendar and reporting daily to Kinga (it goes both ways). Perfect way to keep ourselves accountable and maintain long distance friendship \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: how did you manage to do assigments in a week after they are assigned? I would have big will power problems\nPersona: I've been lately experimenting a lot with calender too, come up with this one method, working good so far, but not mature to share yet\nPersona: Once a few weeks? :oooo\nPersona: Hm\nPersona: I do mass cooking every week, but I dont freeze stuff\nPersona: Shopping wise, hm perhaps I could try online\nPersona: maybe I should also try freezing\nPersona: Overall I feel like there is a lot in common that we do regarding this whole productivity theory\nFriend: I see them as something to \u201eget rid of\u201d xd Assignments are related to what we had on the lectures/classes. Doing the them helps me understand the most important concepts and I don\u2019t have to study that much later on.\nFriend: As I said, my \u201ctechniques\u201d are no rocket science but it took me some time to build and adapt this mindset\nFriend: Yeah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m only eating frozen meals but the thing is that I don\u2019t have to cook if I don\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s why I also mentioned having ingredients for all of the basic and quick meals.\nFor me it\u2019s mainly oatmeal, pasta and miso soup. I can make these in around 15min so I don\u2019t consider it as \u201ccooking\u201d\nFriend: Oh and also, with my lifestyle it\u2019s very inconvenient to do it differently. As I have a few projects going on, there\u2019s more important and fun stuff to worry about than throwing all nighters to do some assignments ;) that\u2019s the engine for my will power\nPersona: a nice danish song\nPersona: with english part\nPersona: ugh, yeah, but they are usuallly at low urgency after they get assigned\nPersona: I stopped eating oatmeal rn. I got too bored finally\nFriend: I\u2019m preparing for a hybrid way of living that I wish to have. Soo being able to work and study anywhere anytime? Check. Having (almost) no fresh produce in the fridge? Check. Minimising the amount of stuff that I own? Check.\n\nHaving all that brings me lots of convenience and peace\nPersona: true, the goal of this semester for now is to not have any allnighters\nPersona: its the bane of my will to live\nFriend: So be the one who creates that urgency. Treat yourself with doing more important things after you get rid of those\nPersona: that is a nice setup\nFriend: I have classes only on some of the weekends so usually I start working on notes and assignments in the evenings during the weekend or on the first few days after that(for bigger assignments).

Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what do you mean?\nFriend: To help Nathalie with moving dog\nFriend: Also I kind of wanted before to rent for dating a car sometimes\nFriend: Can go to nice places or pick up the girl\nFriend: This would be thursday if possible\nPersona: yeah sure man\nPersona: just let me know\nPersona: sure\nPersona: You can pick it up today anytime or Thursday anytime.

I like the two way embeds so much. They were my eternal complain in mindmanager, as they didn't exist\nFriend: what if there is a circular reference \nwill it be infinite note\nFriend: but that's really cool!\nFriend: and what are the motivational quotes that show up :D that's neat\nFriend: can't be CTO before you become coder! xD\nPersona: yeah, then it will be infinite loop xd\nPersona: I think it tried once, i dont remember what happened\nPersona: yeah, anything hashtag #quote will eventually show up\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: impressive setup\nFriend: can't wait to clean my room\n\nand then I want logseq!\nPersona: I think you will love it\nPersona: might be hard to love at first, but once you tame it\nPersona: Literally spent whole day writing this statement of purpose and I am yet to be done\nPersona: Either I am unproductive, or either I am unproductive or either I set the bar too high for this task\nFriend: important task\nget it done good\n\nI'll go write mine too\nFriend: had food\nhad nap\nhad game\nready now\nPersona: its 22:50 PM\nPersona: now is overstatement\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: if you have time, can I ask you for a proofread\nPersona: It reads quite smooth\nI think your points match the information systems type of student well.\nNot sure if its worth mentioning the MIO guest student part. I think since you took electives for a whole semester and are doing Digital Business there now, you can conclude/show the same points from these parts. I dont think its bad to have it, but instead, I would cut it and illustrate a few points you made with examples, stories. Something sounding more personal and unique, more you. Perhaps a story from metro? And think that few detailed, unique, clearly personal example is better than many abstractions.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I read texts, and then when I take notes, I apply levels of formating to each word regarding their added value to the text. So from this\nPersona: I get to this\nPersona: I want a GPT model, to do this selection for me, but its not that easy\nPersona: I asked it to mark important parts but I think it sucks\nPersona: But when I asked it to \"Can you rewrite this paragraph without changing words, but by just removing all of the words that are less significant to the main point?\" it was kinda not bad, but it ended up adding a few new words and not much of the text was reduced.\nPersona: This is not bad tho\nPersona: this is actually good\nPersona: Imagine then having a slider, which allow you to 'control the contrast of the text'\nPersona: Where as higher the contrast the more less significant words get dimmed and the more significant words get emphasized\nPersona: skimming just became easier\nPersona: I had to try it\nPersona: But idk, not happy with results. Tried tuning it a bit, changing prompts, but what I got to does not feel like what I would do\nPersona: Although the last one is not that bad\nPersona: Give me some text tommorow that you had to read or smth, could be multiple pages and pdf also good, I will run it through so highlight/hide the text.\nPersona: Dude makes fun tech stories\nFriend: Yooo\nYou wrote a lot of ai stuff\nHaven't had time to see all\nPersona: fuck it\nPersona: if you have time :Dd\nPersona: then read it, otherwise, can be skipped\nFriend: Its interesting qhat you found\nCause i wanna try using lang chain to make ai docs\nFriend: Lol nice\nFriend: Always slipping\n\nIts like ice skating shoes but for asphalt\nPersona: Xddd\nPersona: The artsyles prompt ideas are pretty cool though. And combining them is nice\nPersona: Good for making steam, forum avatars\nPersona: What do you use for notetaking?\nFriend: Notion is the shit imo\nFriend: Used it during internship\nFriend: Have a journal there\nFriend: And anything that has a time i try to immediately put in the calendar so i can keep track of life\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: No social tomorrow\nPersona: why\nFriend: I hitmy leg the other day now i gotta catch up with classes\nFriend: Was at rentgen\nFriend: Nothing bad tho\nPersona: oh crap\nFriend: My toe blue tho\nFriend: :F\nPersona: where did u hit it?\nFriend: Sliped getting up and rammed it in bed legs\nFriend: My left leg is fucked xD\nThe big toe and pointer are fucked from hits in previous years\nFriend: Im asamed to show my funny nails and toes now\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I expected you were doing some awesome stiiff like bouldering, running xd\nPersona: but no\nPersona: just at home xd\nPersona: I hope it heals well\nFriend: Thanks\nSoon i start\nWeather is getting better too\nPersona: I was to DTU today\nPersona: the tech entrepreneurship  MSc is just made for me\nPersona: Hey, do you know much about autoregression?\nPersona: Specifically, how to know how many order to use in AR\nPersona: this is relating to autocorrelation\nFriend: Yeh there is one thing to use that shows you a picture\nFriend: If the lines go out of line, you counthow many lines go out\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: How do I know how much lags do i use for autoregression now?\nFriend: Bro wtf\nFriend: The first time it goes under the blue i think is ur number\nPersona: 18????\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I played some version of that a year ago with Nathalia\nFriend: Multiplayer?\nFriend: Fuck my exam\nFriend: Think thats the original\nPersona: ahh thats nice\nPersona: but it looks like the gameplay is very different\nPersona: the backpack battles are only PVP\nPersona: And its like 1 match is 30 min or smth\nPersona: With ranked play\nFriend: \ud83e\udee0\nPersona: thats nice\nPersona: wrong img\nPersona: take ur gf on a date\nPersona: me each hours of exam two all nighter\nFriend: .. damn\nFriend: makes me feel less alone\nFriend: i just unlocked big brain\nbecause hand-in is within 24hours\nFriend: do you remember this movie about a machine reading messages in ww2 from movie night\nI feel like the guy that figured out how to make sure the enemy doesn't detect the usage\nFriend: I'm putting in fake characters in the report and theorizing how to make it undetectable\n\nmake it a small % of a part of the report so that even if there is a character analyzing system, it wouldn't detect it as anomaly\nFriend: otherwise you could use 1px font zalgo with almost white color \nbut that shits riskier i think\nPersona: damn u got one too\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: riskier\nPersona: this is cool\nPersona: my technique is writing  my whole assigment in bullet points and the run them through GPT4\nPersona: thats what I was doing\nPersona: able to output pages at almost the same speed I am able to think\nPersona: academic writing, grammar, sentence strcture, paragraph stucture becomes less relevant\nPersona: My initial prompt is \"I am writing an essay about suitable business models for company Skin Bliss, I am writing it piece by piece.

If a loan has a rate like 25%+, even if the person is asking for 5% premium, I could buy it and then it would become a 20% loan for me, but with lower risk, as the person was already paying on time for a while\nPersona: I think I got a history of 400+ loans, I been looking forward to doing some analysis to actually find strategies to optimize this\nPersona: baught 2 like those right noe\nPersona: now*\nPersona: will check sometimes, and then see\nFriend: uuu and the research was on danish market or european? there can be some cultural differencies which can impact the risk\nFriend: or even economic state, like now we are close to recession so that can also make an impact\nPersona: I dont remember\nPersona: when I see it again I can tell you\nPersona: I need to look into how loans respond to economic downturns\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice\nPersona: i will try later cause its minimum 250 chars\nPersona: and im on phone\nPersona: in 20 min.

It can't show something to someone not in neuroscience yet.\nPersona: would that be right?\nFriend: I think that's a good way to look at it. it's useful for the sake of perfecting the methodology (both in terms of what to do and what not to do), but we haven't really come any closer to understanding what differentiates entrepreneurs from the gen. population\nPersona: okay, fair enough\nPersona: ty for the patience haha\nFriend: not gonna lie, choosing the post nye hangover day for discussing science is quite cruel of you \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: but you're very welcome\nPersona: ahaahah how was your NY?\nFriend: I was actually at the dorm with a couple of friends\nFriend: honestly, I think that was the most chill nye 'party' of my life\nFriend: we were just having drinks and playing board games until 6 in the morning\nFriend: how was yours?\nPersona: the fireworks weren't that good here haha, I was also home\nPersona: I had literallly the most chill too\nPersona: I felt a bit sick so stayed home, talked with friends on discord\nPersona: So I am alive and healthy today, apart from having an inverse daynight cycle for the past wekk\nFriend: oh god, I'm so sick of those. it felt like going through a war zone when I was biking to the dorm from home\nFriend: aw shame I didn't know. you could've joined us\nFriend: glad it's nothing serious. you're coming back to school already or you're having a longer Christmas break?\nPersona: isn't the bass you feel in your chest after an explosion kind of thrilling to you?\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away.

The people\nFriend: see if they have connections and shit and if I can make some with them\n\notherwise idk if worth\nPersona: My two colleagues, Vilma and Aske are studying Digitalization masters at CBS now\nPersona: The fact that I will have to be put with different breed like Vilma together into same course keeps me away from it.\nFriend: nice!\n\nI think for cbs students they have a bit different curriculum also. Cause you studied some stuff in bachelors so it should be better\nPersona: I want to experience the deep, antisocial breed of computer scientists, so I can learn their language, norms and signals to explot their skill well later in business and also learn to do the heavy-lifting myself when needed\nFriend: can't help but imagine this when you speak about the antisocial breed of comp sci\nPersona: what was your thesis topic?\nPersona: :DDDDD\nFriend: :( i dont really know\n\nsome stuff I wrote with Corinne about her company:\n\nExploring Business Processes and\nData-Driven Strategies in Outsourced\nMarketing and Outbound Sales\n(with VAEKST)\nPersona: xddd you dont know?\nPersona: \"Data-Driven Strategies in Outsourced\nMarketing and Outbound Sales\" sounds good\nFriend: ppl making errors in entering data at her company\n\nso 2 options, better process and teaching ppl or automate the shit and don't bother with ppl\nPersona: nice tldr\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\nFriend: i get this\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\nPersona: well almost applied\nPersona: I am confused. I have the legal right for Digital Business masters\nPersona: so what do I put in the personal statement field.

If you also need to think about pages, then its an extra variable in your decision making process.\nPersona: Logseq automates that, so any single block can be a page, you just press on it to zoom in and it becomes the root element\nPersona: But they also have pages (which is sometimes till needed so files don't get too large and if you want to collaborate, so you can work in diff files, like in coding)\nPersona: The only issue with Logseq is that its less stable and feels a little weirder and less polished than Obsidian. Obsidian is super smooth\nPersona: Next semester I will try switching uni notes to Logseq, but I am a little anxious. There will be many improvements with that - like I can't wait till I can use block embeds, also I will be able to share my notes with other people in a standardized format. Search functionality is better too.\nPersona: But I am anxious that the mindmap layout presentation will turn out to be much more superior to bullet list presentation when it comes to complex topics I will study. Also in Logseq there is less options for content visual customization, so making things standout is more limited (bolding, colors still work).\nPersona: bruuug sweet\nPersona: you look good\nFriend: Thanks man\nWas a good time\nFriend: I'm happy she wants to show me\nFriend: Was thinking some days before that ppl post on diff social media diff side of them and was wondering if she will just want her own photos on instagram\nFriend: Or would she show me\nFriend: Cause ive heard a lot instagram is more for dating kind of\nFriend: What are block embeds\nFriend: Yeah.. i want some way to combine mindmanager mindmaps with note app\nPersona: ig is general purpose social media\nPersona: i dont think it has much specialization like linkedin which is for professionals\nPersona: almost everykind of businness has ig profile these days\nPersona: I think instsgram is good for dating, but its the same as saying 'a car is good for dating'. Ita good but its not made for it specifically\nPersona: You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. \n\nobj_A = Object()\n\nobj_A.var1 = \"hello\"\nobj_A2 = obj_A\nobj_A2.var1 = \"world\"\nprint(obj_A.var1) // \"world\"\nPersona: thats prob best way to explain it\nPersona: its like a mirror reference thats editable\nPersona: mindmanager is so bad for integrations\nFriend: They have that?\n\nWhere does the real obj live\nIs one original and other are references\nFriend: Huh\nYoutube-like?\nFriend: But with photos\nPersona: I will show you later\nPersona: bro do you really have no idea how instragram is used?\nPersona: Its not like youtube in many ways. Its just very general. Less general than facebook, but fb has just became too general for the new times\nPersona: you post updates about what you do, about your interests, show off some aesthetic you capture, show off the imagine of yourself you are creating, show your hobbies maybe, show your personality in reel, photos, stories\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)"

I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible.

Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually.

Doing the them helps me understand the most important concepts and I don\u2019t have to study that much later on.\nFriend: As I said, my \u201ctechniques\u201d are no rocket science but it took me some time to build and adapt this mindset\nFriend: Yeah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m only eating frozen meals but the thing is that I don\u2019t have to cook if I don\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s why I also mentioned having ingredients for all of the basic and quick meals.\nFor me it\u2019s mainly oatmeal, pasta and miso soup. I can make these in around 15min so I don\u2019t consider it as \u201ccooking\u201d\nFriend: Oh and also, with my lifestyle it\u2019s very inconvenient to do it differently.

I got too bored finally\nFriend: I\u2019m preparing for a hybrid way of living that I wish to have. Soo being able to work and study anywhere anytime? Check. Having (almost) no fresh produce in the fridge? Check. Minimising the amount of stuff that I own? Check.\n\nHaving all that brings me lots of convenience and peace\nPersona: true, the goal of this semester for now is to not have any allnighters\nPersona: its the bane of my will to live\nFriend: So be the one who creates that urgency. Treat yourself with doing more important things after you get rid of those\nPersona: that is a nice setup\nFriend: I have classes only on some of the weekends so usually I start working on notes and assignments in the evenings during the weekend or on the first few days after that(for bigger assignments). Is it tiring? Yes. But does it pay off? Very much\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Can u open ?\nFriend: For us ?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: bri\nPersona: u good\nPersona: where r u?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: Hey man, how are you?\nFriend: You missed a call from Denis.\nFriend: Fine ^^\nPersona: You called Denis.\nPersona: did you get any charges yesterday?\nPersona: I haven't talked to gustav so i dont know what kind of and if he filed any official complains\nPersona: I am sober now and I start to realize, that man, you did some bad stuff yesterday.

I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%.

Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah.

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them?

She is applying to innofounder and needs one in three weeks\nFriend: Ooh.she is in need of technical person for her startup?\nPersona: Same with my friend Karla\nPersona: she founded KeepIt half a year ago and have been changing CTOs multiple times\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: she needs a CTO, one that can set the technical vision, understand trends in tech and also build the product\nFriend: Messenger become such ass.. something with this new security update\nPersona: lol weird\nFriend: Won't load me messages rn .. happens on computer too\nFriend: Bad messenger cto\nPersona: I had weird stuff with IG chat\nPersona: facebook is getting old\nPersona: I would recommend you too, but as I understood she is not deploying on web technology, she was mentioning xcode, iOS apps being able to be compiled to Apple Vision VR and also mentioned Flutter\nFriend: That sounds actually interesting for people that are wanting to do startups\nPersona: whats the status on Scroll Bar tmmrow btw?\nFriend: Bruh x__x I never trust business people when they want pure mobile app\n\nBecause you can make a js html css app that is just as good and they wouldn't even know it's made with js\nPersona: She is build VR software\nFriend: Ida will put us in the list on the morning\nPersona: building*\nPersona: I forgot the idea, but it should be on VR\nFriend: Js supports WebXR \nPlayed a few html cs js stuff on VR\nPersona: hmm idk, the one PWA that I been using is getting really fucking laggy as they keep adding content\nFriend: Was experimental tho.. depends on features needed\nPersona: but maybe thats one case\nPersona: if PWAs perform well in the end, then yeah I agree\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\nFriend: ah \nyeah I guess if you ask the question to someone random, they wouldn't be ready to answer so you can't really get deeper connection\nPersona: yeah, but you can get deep stuff out of that.\nPersona: So once you reach that level, this can scale the relationship well\nPersona: 'scale the relationship'\nPersona: holy shit, this is becoming a science haha\nFriend: :D\nFriend: economics\nFriend: you have diseconomies of scale with relationships\nFriend: unless you use this one simple trick xD\nPersona: xddd\nPersona: lol\nPersona: Yeah I guess its  unit-of-time-invested/unit-of-relationship-utility would give something similar to economic scale and diseconomies of scale graph.\nFriend: i kind of want to test that\nFriend: but some of the questions I feel hard asking them in person if around other people\nFriend: these feel more like 1:1\nFriend: questions\nPersona: yeah, some. Some can be good.

As relax as it gets. I went from most rediculous strict german to this super fun, relax\nPersona: My manager baught me ice scream today\nPersona: last friday we were celebrating that this one dude (many tatoos, like gangsta mf) did the most sales in previous year.

Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nFriend: I btw found a superior api subscription.

I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Can u open ?\nFriend: For us ?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: bri\nPersona: u good\nPersona: where r u?\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: Denis called you.\nPersona: Hey man, how are you?\nFriend: You missed a call from Denis.\nFriend: Fine ^^\nPersona: You called Denis.\nPersona: did you get any charges yesterday?\nPersona: I haven't talked to gustav so i dont know what kind of and if he filed any official complains\nPersona: I am sober now and I start to realize, that man, you did some bad stuff yesterday. You should really be careful and more responsible in parties\nFriend: You missed a call from Denis.\nPersona: You called Denis.\nFriend: I know, will talk to u later\nFriend: You missed a call from Denis.\nFriend: You missed a call from Denis.\nPersona: Denis missed your call.\nPersona: wassup, I was at work sorry\nFriend: Denis called you.\nFriend: If you can maybe pick us up Tuesday 15:00 at K\u00f8ge from work, take us home for Dana pick her drivning licens, and than drive us to mechanic. We can manage it all for 2 hours I guess.\nFriend: Otherways we will change trains and busses for 5-6 hours.\nFriend: :D\nPersona: I have work that time man, its during working hours\nFriend: No worries \ud83d\ude42\nPersona: Sorry mate\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\nPersona: haha\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\nFriend: i get this\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\nPersona: well almost applied\nPersona: I am confused. I have the legal right for Digital Business masters\nPersona: so what do I put in the personal statement field. Its required\nPersona: LOL shortest personal statement ever\nPersona: Whats your 2nd and 3rd prio?\nFriend: Do you need that\nFriend: No other prios\nPersona: straight to IS\nPersona: no othet option\nPersona: I like it\nPersona: sup my friend\nPersona: whar r u up to\nPersona: I woke up just now from a peaceful.sleel\nPersona: sleep*\nPersona: I cant cure the addiction to rimworld. I cant even search for it properly. The devs thought about it before hand by introducinh in-game addiction\nPersona: I have realized that I fall into the combined category of RimWorld, Minecraft and Factorio games\nPersona: gamers*\nPersona: cause many peoplr when talking about rimworld addiction refference mostky factorio\nPersona: and sometimes minecraft and oxygen not included\nFriend: yeah! Signed up for that through CBS\n\nare you going?\nFriend: was with Laura \nshe had bday\nPersona: I missed the good tickets\nPersona: so now its the 2hour ones lefy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\nPersona: thats a CV\nPersona: You are hired!\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: The most stressfull part is when your best colonist is about to bleed out in 1 hour and you are hoping a medic can patch them up just in time\nPersona: or when somebody gets an infection and the immunity build up rate has to surpass the infection rate\nPersona: thats real stress\nPersona: but I don't think about that\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is not getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is now getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison (edited)\nFriend: sounds unreal\nwhen you describe things like that I imagine it's some Red dead redemption graphics kind of game\nFriend: but with even more freedom in choice what to do\nPersona: but you get this graphic\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\nFriend: i get this\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\nPersona: well almost applied\nPersona: I am confused. I have the legal right for Digital Business masters\nPersona: so what do I put in the personal statement field. Its required\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: .\nPersona: .\nPersona: .\nPersona: .\nPersona: .\nPersona: .\nPersona: .\nPersona: \ud83d\udda4\nPersona: .\nPersona: \ud83d\udda4\nPersona: .\nPersona: .\nPersona: .\nPersona: ok man\nPersona: you can come to us\nPersona: we are waiting \ud83d\ude18\nPersona: \ud83d\udda4\nPersona: \ud83d\udda4\nPersona: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f missed your call.\nPersona: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f missed your call.\nPersona: I will call.you a third time like a spoiled bitcb\nPersona: (I am drunk)\nPersona: You would be driving two drunk  crazy chicks, think about it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f missed your call.\nPersona: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f missed your call.\nPersona: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f missed your call.\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\nPersona: ok lady has to peee n stuff\nPersona: few more mins\nPersona: chill\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore.

I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%.

I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them.

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I think Ottar send in to the groupchat back in the day\nFriend: Are you guys doing an information audit for imo ?\nFriend: Yeah I am\nFriend: Did you include all the steps mentioned in buchanans paper like a pestle analysis etc. ?\nFriend: Not all of them no i focus on the identify and analyse stages\nFriend: Ok thanks Marcus\nFriend: So I do actually make a small PEST analysis\nFriend: Alright that\u2019s good to know\nFriend: I think it would be nice to meet in person to prepare for the oral next week\nFriend: So when would you guys be available?\nFriend: Preferably after Friday\nFriend: But I\u2019m free whenever\nFriend: I'm free after friday as well but I have to work one day either monday, tuesday, or wednesday\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s best to meet earlier in the week\nFriend: I would suggest you maybe schedule work for Wednesday but let\u2019s see when the others are free\nFriend: I think so as well but don't wanna schedule anything yet in case they are only available wednesday\nFriend: wednesday is good for me\nFriend: Only Wednesday?\nFriend: Because I think Monday or Tuesday would be better\nFriend: monday is also good\nFriend: I would also prefer to have two days so if it fits  @Airidas let's do monday and wednesday\nFriend: sounds great\nPersona: I am working on Monday.

Just abusing google calendar and reporting daily to Kinga (it goes both ways). Perfect way to keep ourselves accountable and maintain long distance friendship \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: how did you manage to do assigments in a week after they are assigned? I would have big will power problems\nPersona: I've been lately experimenting a lot with calender too, come up with this one method, working good so far, but not mature to share yet\nPersona: Once a few weeks? :oooo\nPersona: Hm\nPersona: I do mass cooking every week, but I dont freeze stuff\nPersona: Shopping wise, hm perhaps I could try online\nPersona: maybe I should also try freezing\nPersona: Overall I feel like there is a lot in common that we do regarding this whole productivity theory\nFriend: I see them as something to \u201eget rid of\u201d xd Assignments are related to what we had on the lectures/classes. Doing the them helps me understand the most important concepts and I don\u2019t have to study that much later on.\nFriend: As I said, my \u201ctechniques\u201d are no rocket science but it took me some time to build and adapt this mindset\nFriend: Yeah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m only eating frozen meals but the thing is that I don\u2019t have to cook if I don\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s why I also mentioned having ingredients for all of the basic and quick meals.\nFor me it\u2019s mainly oatmeal, pasta and miso soup. I can make these in around 15min so I don\u2019t consider it as \u201ccooking\u201d\nFriend: Oh and also, with my lifestyle it\u2019s very inconvenient to do it differently. As I have a few projects going on, there\u2019s more important and fun stuff to worry about than throwing all nighters to do some assignments ;) that\u2019s the engine for my will power\nPersona: a nice danish song\nPersona: with english part\nPersona: ugh, yeah, but they are usuallly at low urgency after they get assigned\nPersona: I stopped eating oatmeal rn. I got too bored finally\nFriend: I\u2019m preparing for a hybrid way of living that I wish to have. Soo being able to work and study anywhere anytime? Check. Having (almost) no fresh produce in the fridge? Check. Minimising the amount of stuff that I own? Check.\n\nHaving all that brings me lots of convenience and peace\nPersona: true, the goal of this semester for now is to not have any allnighters\nPersona: its the bane of my will to live\nFriend: So be the one who creates that urgency. Treat yourself with doing more important things after you get rid of those\nPersona: that is a nice setup\nFriend: I have classes only on some of the weekends so usually I start working on notes and assignments in the evenings during the weekend or on the first few days after that(for bigger assignments). Is it tiring? Yes. But does it pay off? Very much\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: idk why\nPersona: Did they say we start 8:30?\nFriend: Hmm, ok mb\nPersona: yeah its weird\nPersona: very early\nPersona: I sent the coordinator a message\nPersona: maybe its a mistake\nPersona: Okay its not a mistake\nPersona: She replied\nPersona: My shift starts at 7:15 \ud83d\ude28\nFriend: Ok, i start 8:30 lol\nFriend: Yo\nFriend: Wanna smoke a sig ?\nPersona: Yes\nPersona: a bit later\nFriend: Where r u ?\nPersona: BBQ stage\nFriend: I am here\nFriend: Are u still here ?\nPersona: yup\nFriend: Where ?\nFriend: U now\nPersona: Where u at?\nFriend: Sry\nFriend: I went to garderop\nFriend: Pick my stuff\nPersona: Wazzzzeeeep\nPersona: wya?\nFriend: Suuuuuppppp\nFriend: Lunar\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\nPersona: haha\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future"

If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: for motivation\nPersona: with food?\nPersona: xddd\nPersona: a game of what?\nFriend: league \nwreckfest \ndoesn't matter\nPersona: Xddd\nFriend: just kill time so pressure builds up\nPersona: omg\nFriend: so i can write better\nPersona: bruuuh\nPersona: thats unhealthh\nPersona: I end up like that\nPersona: too\nPersona: but not on purpose\nFriend: xD I mean..\nFriend: I wanna get it done\nFriend: but also idk\nFriend: btw\nPersona: I am taking so long for this statement of purpose for DTU holy shit\nFriend: if you wanna do coding cross platform\n\nworth checking out Expo and how it works\nFriend: statement of purpose? that something like motivational letter\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: I will set a reminder to check it out after march 1\nFriend: I can just show you \nif I get into it\nFriend: and remind\nPersona: Lightshot hack to get direct image link by right clicking if needed using Custom CSS\nPersona: I found godly plugin for logseq\nPersona: I gotta introduce you to logseq some daay\nPersona: it is pure heaven for a rational brain\nPersona: what are you using for note taking?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just did use it\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\nPersona: no peace\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\nPersona: I'll try\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\nFriend: nooo\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\nFriend: I love that clip\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\nFriend: other than Venus\nFriend: because that would suck\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\nPersona: you have good ideas\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It highlights code better and API is always faster than ChatGPT\nPersona: plus after you pay smth to openAI, you get GPT4\nPersona: Been using it for two weeks\nFriend: Wanna try the rajnbow one\nFriend: Need snacks now for the papers i work on\nFriend: Youll have to show me\nPersona: just open it and put in your api key\nPersona: no need to install\nPersona: Material 3 is so cool, approachable and easy to understand\nPersona: Soo fucking good for making an MVP\nPersona: Yeah its mint and dark choc. havent tried yet\nPersona: I like Material 3 color scheme system\nFriend: Oh no\nEww\nThats why i havent tried\nFriend: Tastes to me like toothpaste in the chocolate\nPersona: :DDDDD\nFriend: I tried after eight with mint\nPersona: We have a freelance copywriter that we hire at twentythree. I was experimenting today with GPT4, with giving it a huge chunk of our copy for context and then asking it to generate copy for landing page given a structure.\nPersona: It did pretty good\nPersona: With just 2 pages of context\nPersona: What I think I will do is I will download the whole database of our website, extract all the content and then tag it by 1) Page 2) Type of component belonging to 3) Type of text.\nPersona: Then, for each use case, I can cherry-pick these categories to select the most relevant context and also designate exactly the type of the component and type of text I am looking to put the output in.\nPersona: I can glue it all together with Google Sheets and Apps Script, so its super easy to interface with\nPersona: Select parameters, click button and Google Sheet would spit out a single-prompt recipe for the needed copy that I need to give to GPT4, give that and voila\nPersona: I feel cruel if I try to do this in regard to our copywriter\nPersona: But. tech is advancing, ya gotta do what ya gotta do\nFriend: im so bad at studying\nFriend: watching how to grow potatoes\nFriend: struggle is real\nFriend: single handedly putting your colleagues out of work\nFriend: would be really good move if you got your own team\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: img actually shows when you finish editing that piece\nFriend: thats good\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: the matrix thingy is from a plugin, so its looks a bit unsexy by default, eespecially with the embed\nPersona: but I am sure a few lines of CSS can fix it\nPersona: u can have borders in kanban too\nPersona: most of the things here are this one OP plugin that I found, thats why I got so lit up\nPersona: So its not perfect at places\nPersona: but Logseq is cool without this plugin too. I like the two way embeds so much. They were my eternal complain in mindmanager, as they didn't exist\nFriend: what if there is a circular reference \nwill it be infinite note\nFriend: but that's really cool!\nFriend: and what are the motivational quotes that show up :D that's neat\nFriend: can't be CTO before you become coder! xD\nPersona: yeah, then it will be infinite loop xd\nPersona: I think it tried once, i dont remember what happened\nPersona: yeah, anything hashtag #quote will eventually show up\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: impressive setup\nFriend: can't wait to clean my room\n\nand then I want logseq!\nPersona: I think you will love it\nPersona: might be hard to love at first, but once you tame it\nPersona: Literally spent whole day writing this statement of purpose and I am yet to be done\nPersona: Either I am unproductive, or either I am unproductive or either I set the bar too high for this task\nFriend: important task\nget it done good\n\nI'll go write mine too\nFriend: had food\nhad nap\nhad game\nready now\nPersona: its 22:50 PM\nPersona: now is overstatement\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: if you have time, can I ask you for a proofread\nPersona: It reads quite smooth\nI think your points match the information systems type of student well.\nNot sure if its worth mentioning the MIO guest student part. I think since you took electives for a whole semester and are doing Digital Business there now, you can conclude/show the same points from these parts. I dont think its bad to have it, but instead, I would cut it and illustrate a few points you made with examples, stories. Something sounding more personal and unique, more you. Perhaps a story from metro? And think that few detailed, unique, clearly personal example is better than many abstractions.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: What is the quickest and cleanest way using only HTML (no css stylesheet) to center a paragraph on a horizontal axis with a picture.\nPersona: I am sending ecom sites descriptions of products and I am including html tags in them to do some styling\nFriend: maybe possible with inline elements\n\notherwise tables\n\nbut css is best if you can use at least inline css\nFriend: if you send me the thing I can test if inline elements can work for it\nPersona: I can use style tag, but not in separte file\nFriend: ye thats ok\nPersona: The site is this\nPersona: this better\nPersona: (I resend)\nFriend: dont send code in fb x__x hard to copy\nfile\npastebin\ngoogle docs\nanything else pls\n\nare you able to change this html you sent me to whatever you want?\nPersona: The description goes under \"APRA\u0160YMAS\" if it makes a difference\nPersona: okay\nPersona: pastebin does not work for me I hate it\nPersona: wait\nFriend: whatever you prefer \njust not messenger\n\nbut thats ok. I got the code\nFriend: can you change whatever you want in it?\nPersona: In that code yeah, I can basically send them html. But a little shitty caveat is that I will have to get rid of <img> tags as they want to upload images themselves so I just put in plain text [IMAGE blahblah.png]\nFriend: check this out\nPersona: Those <img> are there temp just to see how it loks on their end\nFriend: the fastest/easiest way\nPersona: fucking nice\nFriend: put the text paragraph in the one with the image\n\nthen on the group paragraph you apply these rules to center\nFriend: gap is for spacing between the 2 elements (text and image)\nPersona: can you quickly send the part of the code with this\nPersona: now whole thing, just this part\nPersona: mesenger is fine\nFriend: <p style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 1em;\">\n\t<img />\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>GROHE TurboStat</strong>\n\t\tuztikrina pastovia vandens\n\t</p>\n</p>\nFriend: like that?\nPersona: omg\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\nFriend: good luck with statement\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\nFriend: so I can't relax\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: The most stressfull part is when your best colonist is about to bleed out in 1 hour and you are hoping a medic can patch them up just in time\nPersona: or when somebody gets an infection and the immunity build up rate has to surpass the infection rate\nPersona: thats real stress\nPersona: but I don't think about that\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is not getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is now getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison (edited)\nFriend: sounds unreal\nwhen you describe things like that I imagine it's some Red dead redemption graphics kind of game\nFriend: but with even more freedom in choice what to do\nPersona: but you get this graphic\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\nFriend: i get this\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\nPersona: well almost applied\nPersona: I am confused.

I think its the best tool out there\nFriend: You got an affiliate link? \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: They provide free cloud storage for cards too\nPersona: Anki is free\nFriend: Joking\nPersona: (expect for iPhone, idk why that is so stupid)\nFriend: Yeah\nFriend: Just wanted to say that (as an ios user)\nFriend: But its only 100zl\nPersona: I think its worth it\nPersona: Make cards on your laptop, auto-sync to phone and practice on phone in the bath\nFriend: Do you have any pre-made decks to recommend?\nPersona: Not really, I think I only ever downloaded a few, one for US states and one for Spanish\nFriend: Spanish?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just did a month ago. Few people got salary increases, yet I asked for a really fat raise, as a part-timer, and they had to pay me, I made it clear I was not fooling around\nFriend: 1st lol. I never dared to try\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: cant explain, every way I think of explaining would make me sound like a psycho \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: its like there would be atleast so much action to witness, also some chance to survive, depending on type of crash\nPersona: like sinking is a long slow death,  unspectacular when compared\nPersona: gosh lets stop this topic xd\nPersona: so yeah thats why u need the clear relax part\nPersona: are you working now?\nFriend: hahaha okay, I admit I didn't read what you were responding to\nFriend: wowo, I'm so good at this game\nFriend: what do you want me to fix then? the scale? my understanding of the scale?\nFriend: isn't that the one that was supposed to move out?\nFriend: what?! this is like the opposite of psycho death\nFriend: I have a lot questions, but I'm going to be nice and respect your wish\nFriend: semi. I'm at the library learning Matlab\nPersona: omgg xddddd im laughing\nPersona: i actually dont know what, you said the word fix first \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: nah, that was patryk\nPersona: really? is it one of my those misunderstandings of disordee meanings?\nPersona: although I was trying to say it in the nicest way\nPersona: by action to witness, I imagined like cabin pressure loss, hull breaking in two mid air, explosions, flying out of the plane\nPersona: oh well, too late\nPersona: I have expanded more unfortunatelly\nPersona: whaaaat? fo real? I am in my cozy bed, listening to macmiller\nPersona: why matlab tho?\nFriend: eh mistakes were made. okay, change of the strategy. forget the scale. how does your schedule look like in general\nFriend: what. how many Polish friends do you have haha. you have more Polish friends than I do\nFriend: oh no, I was referring to psycho in a common vernacular sense here. I wasn't even considering the psychiatric sense\nFriend: I wonder whether you'd even feel anything if you fell out. I remember the story of that lady who got sucked out of the window and I think she died almost immediately\nPersona: a very generalized version look like this\nFriend: I'm still basically unfurnished so not home much these days\nFriend: I need it for my potential job and in general it's useful in neuro\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: need to re-read when im out of class somewhere quiet\nPersona: I think for the next one, if you want to write smth useful, you can share an insight or idea that you heard and was really interesting. Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\nPersona: WTF\nPersona: mac is cool\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster. Not even exxagerating\nFriend: Oh yeah\n\nWhen Stan showed me, it was magic\nFriend: But i think you can do that on windows too\n\nWith more setup tho\nPersona: Havent read fully but could be interesting\nPersona: If you want to improve decision making speed or suffer from decision paralysis (which I do)\nFriend: looks like a good read\nFriend: I'll check it out\nFriend: I swear my \"almost\" accidents with the bike are mostly women or colored foreigners\nFriend: once an oldie\nFriend: today a woman decided the bike lane means extra points x___x\nFriend: she got scared when I decided to cross\nPersona: Xddd\nPersona: what do you mean? She was with car?\nPersona: Its a consensus that women are worse drivers. But also its pretty known that women get into accidents lets afaik\nPersona: less*\nPersona: If you take pen testing, women have a offensive advantage\nFriend: what\nPersona: xddd idk why this 'what' soundes funny\nPersona: i will explain later\nFriend: Aaah!\nFriend: Like the lady bond villains\nFriend: I got nais balls\nFriend: Really big pack\nPersona: XDDDDDDD\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It means what for\nFriend: Funny one\nPersona: 99% should be correct. Some sentences were made by GPT4 \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: the pronounciations are quite personalized to how I read letters in Lithuanian, so idk if that will help for you \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: almost a tragic miscommunication\nFriend: first I have to figure out how to use it on mac\nPersona: yeaaaah, it can be a bit complex at first\nPersona: ask me questions if you want I am a veteran xd\nFriend: yeah, now I remember why I didn\u2019t use it\nPersona: I have 19000 cards (~10 000 are the spanish ones that I downlaoded, but only went through like 200)\nFriend: i like the comfort of good uxui\nPersona: yeah the UI is semi-modern. It used to be way worse\nFriend: Wasn\u2019t that difficult at the end, synced everything\nFriend: I was actually going to study danish now so gonna try anki\nPersona: let me know how my cards fare\nFriend: Ok, I see how it\u2019s tailored\nFriend: Lad os tale forretning\nPersona: cxddddd\nPersona: oh yeha\nPersona: important phrase to know\nFriend: Gonna be using it often\nFriend: How many cards a day do you usually do? What\u2019s your limit?\nPersona: I havent' been stuying much, except for the past week\nPersona: but\nFriend: Your pronunciation is funny, but it makes sense most of the time\nFriend: Some letters are similar to polish so I\u2019d also write it this way\nFriend: But tbh I just spent some time practicing the danish sounds so it\u2019s easier to read without \u201ctranslating\u201d them\nPersona: if you are only relying on my written pronunciations, I recomend not xdd\nPersona: they are not bad, but idk if they are the same in poland for sure\nFriend: Especially enjoyed practicing soft d\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: although could just manually place , and decapitalize W\nPersona: bruh my work is taking over my mind. I can't focus on studying, I just keep thinking about work\nPersona: as if I am addicted to it.\nFriend: That is beautiful\n\nI loved my work at one point\nAnd my sidehustle\n\nEverything else was second\nFriend: I like that\nGood drive\n\nMaybe bad for relationship or others but i miss the feeling\nFriend: But hard if you think you want a good grade at studies\nPersona: bro, I spam you with so much random stuff and you still read it seriously\nPersona: I thank you for that <3\nPersona: Its the Lunar founder pitching lunar before it got popular\nPersona: dude Silicon Valley tv series is so good\nPersona: the italian is in germany for some wedding or smth, I am watching it alone and not telling it\nPersona: cause its so on point\nPersona: I am so immersed, so many moments are so good\nPersona: and when she comes back I will lovely watch it again pretending I didn't know, its just so good\nPersona: my highschool classmate\nPersona: how would you rate her out of 10?\nFriend: O nice to see the start\nFriend: It's insightful to see those services having to work with traditional finance to make it work\nFriend: I wonder how you make connection with traditional banks and convince them to make use of them in that way\nFriend: Because he did say they are eating their products\nFriend: No\nLooks like Corinne\nFriend: 7+ but really not my style so personally under 5\nPersona: ohh she so diff from corine in my mind.

Hard to find a decent one lower than 800kr\nPersona: I am starting to think about giving repair a retry. But the more I wait, the more I spend on bus.\nPersona: ahhhh, I spend more energy thinking about it than it would cost money equivalent (perhaps)\nPersona: Idk if DYI is always a good strat\nPersona: I like DYI cause I would learn stuff, but its something quite trivial to learn, idk will it be worth later in life.\nPersona: And I better focus on my top impact agenda\nFriend: nice moral dilemma you discovered there\n\nafraid of the addictive qualities but happy with the positive effects\nFriend: Just tried the coolest can opening mechanisn\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: why reply tho?\nPersona: how does it work?\nFriend: hahaha \nthat's the most retarded thing you must have seen xD\nI replied because I wrote something but I guess it didn't go through with the picture\nFriend: I think it's a good dilemma you have there\nFriend: imo if you can control yourself kind of, it's a good thing"

I like the two way embeds so much. They were my eternal complain in mindmanager, as they didn't exist\nFriend: what if there is a circular reference \nwill it be infinite note\nFriend: but that's really cool!\nFriend: and what are the motivational quotes that show up :D that's neat\nFriend: can't be CTO before you become coder! xD\nPersona: yeah, then it will be infinite loop xd\nPersona: I think it tried once, i dont remember what happened\nPersona: yeah, anything hashtag #quote will eventually show up\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: impressive setup\nFriend: can't wait to clean my room\n\nand then I want logseq!\nPersona: I think you will love it\nPersona: might be hard to love at first, but once you tame it\nPersona: Literally spent whole day writing this statement of purpose and I am yet to be done\nPersona: Either I am unproductive, or either I am unproductive or either I set the bar too high for this task\nFriend: important task\nget it done good\n\nI'll go write mine too\nFriend: had food\nhad nap\nhad game\nready now\nPersona: its 22:50 PM\nPersona: now is overstatement\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: if you have time, can I ask you for a proofread\nPersona: It reads quite smooth\nI think your points match the information systems type of student well.\nNot sure if its worth mentioning the MIO guest student part. I think since you took electives for a whole semester and are doing Digital Business there now, you can conclude/show the same points from these parts. I dont think its bad to have it, but instead, I would cut it and illustrate a few points you made with examples, stories. Something sounding more personal and unique, more you. Perhaps a story from metro? And think that few detailed, unique, clearly personal example is better than many abstractions.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\nPersona: here\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\nFriend: Catchy\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1. Something you want to save up money to spend. The Shoes.\n2. Ways in which you can weekly save money. Don't order take-out today/this week.\nPersona: So it can be quite confusing. But calling the 2nd a 'step' then sort of a forces to have some goal too. But if we can have some different naming...\nPersona: we can also discus this tmmrow\nFriend: Ok I\u2019ll think about it\nFriend: can some of u remember what the more detailed background for \"indifferent\" means in this table\nFriend: bc i am trying to describe the customers further using this and indifferent would not work bc it does not really tell anything so maybe its the same as not interested in PF?\nFriend: I think we should have it be 2 scenarios that users can choose and change from at any given time. Not sure how well it works if they run at the same time \n\n1. original idea \n2. your idea\n\nHowever, I think there should only be 2 elements to it because otherwise it becomes inconsistent imo\n\nSo Goal > daily nudges \n\nName idea for daily nudges could be \u201ddaily-dos\u201c\nFriend: Yeah I think indifferent means they just don\u2019t care\nFriend: Or yes-ification instead of notification\nPersona: It sounds like the same\nPersona: yesification xdddd\nPersona: what is original idea and your idea?\nFriend: This is yours\nPersona: I think daily nudges is fine. Cause some ways to save mainly consists of don't. So daily-do's would limit the kind of nudges we can have.\nPersona: Whats the original?\nPersona: Without the goal?\nFriend: The initial think we talked about today. Where you can choose a weekly goal based on the multi-select question\nFriend: But then we have to decide if we want that to be a circle that reoccurs every week or how\nPersona: The 'change of scenarios' then should not be like a switch-button. If you don't set \"adidas shoes' goal', Then you are in scenario \"Original idea\". If you do set 'adidas shoes' goal, then you are in \"Your idea\" scenario. What do you think about that?\nFriend: so then i feel like being lazy and not into personla finance are kin dof in the same space as well bc they would take up a lot of people then.... I would make more sense to write that people are lazy and not into doing their personal finances rather than they dont care abt right? or am i fishing\nPersona: But the reason I am saying 'adidas shoes' goal is because there is a disambiguity between the two types of goals we are talking about. This is what I mean that we need to invest different words for that.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know.

I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im not xd\nPersona: church give me anxiety\nFriend: Hey Airi!\nWhat did you use for location based reminder? I can't seem to set one\nPersona: Google Keep\nFriend: Ah good old classic\nFriend: Only manually setting location reminders?\nFriend: Ai gf on the rise\nPersona: yeah, I think so\nPersona: BRUUUUUH\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: I am too sober the get this\nFriend: I'll break it down\n\neverybody partakes in gang related activities = everybody gangsta\nFriend: until the non orientable manifold starts \n\n(a human however i just researched is an orientable manifold)\n\norientability is about topology of a shape.. idk what was the idea here\nFriend: starts spilling the beans = spills the beans\nFriend: it means confessing in slang\nFriend: starts dispensing the beans* XD\nFriend: it's very.. layered\n\nyou have surrealism on top of slang\nPersona: I am almost there, but what does the non oriebtable really mean here?\nFriend: think its just the one that is ratting others out\n\nthink it was supposed to mean human\nFriend: but humans are orientable so idk that part\nPersona: its indeed very layered\nFriend: I don't remember if I had asked you before but \ndo you think am I autistic?\nhow far am i on the spectrum :D\nPersona: bro what is this question xddd\nPersona: I dont think you are autistic, I also dont really know anyone autistic so I cant really tell\nPersona: do you have some doubts you are autistic?\nFriend: met a girl that is diagnosed\n\nI wanna do some research and see..\nEither I'm weird cause of life circumstances or cause a bit of autism :D\nFriend: either is fine but I'm curious now\nPersona: Hm, maybe its not good to diagnose stuff for yourself\nPersona: How does that girl appear?\nFriend: how does she appear? wdym\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I don't like page based, because a big task in note-taking is deciding where to put what and then deciding where to look for what. If you also need to think about pages, then its an extra variable in your decision making process.\nPersona: Logseq automates that, so any single block can be a page, you just press on it to zoom in and it becomes the root element\nPersona: But they also have pages (which is sometimes till needed so files don't get too large and if you want to collaborate, so you can work in diff files, like in coding)\nPersona: The only issue with Logseq is that its less stable and feels a little weirder and less polished than Obsidian. Obsidian is super smooth\nPersona: Next semester I will try switching uni notes to Logseq, but I am a little anxious. There will be many improvements with that - like I can't wait till I can use block embeds, also I will be able to share my notes with other people in a standardized format. Search functionality is better too.\nPersona: But I am anxious that the mindmap layout presentation will turn out to be much more superior to bullet list presentation when it comes to complex topics I will study. Also in Logseq there is less options for content visual customization, so making things standout is more limited (bolding, colors still work).\nPersona: bruuug sweet\nPersona: you look good\nFriend: Thanks man\nWas a good time\nFriend: I'm happy she wants to show me\nFriend: Was thinking some days before that ppl post on diff social media diff side of them and was wondering if she will just want her own photos on instagram\nFriend: Or would she show me\nFriend: Cause ive heard a lot instagram is more for dating kind of\nFriend: What are block embeds\nFriend: Yeah.. i want some way to combine mindmanager mindmaps with note app\nPersona: ig is general purpose social media\nPersona: i dont think it has much specialization like linkedin which is for professionals\nPersona: almost everykind of businness has ig profile these days\nPersona: I think instsgram is good for dating, but its the same as saying 'a car is good for dating'. Ita good but its not made for it specifically\nPersona: You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. \n\nobj_A = Object()\n\nobj_A.var1 = \"hello\"\nobj_A2 = obj_A\nobj_A2.var1 = \"world\"\nprint(obj_A.var1) // \"world\"\nPersona: thats prob best way to explain it\nPersona: its like a mirror reference thats editable\nPersona: mindmanager is so bad for integrations\nFriend: They have that?\n\nWhere does the real obj live\nIs one original and other are references\nFriend: Huh\nYoutube-like?\nFriend: But with photos\nPersona: I will show you later\nPersona: bro do you really have no idea how instragram is used?\nPersona: Its not like youtube in many ways. Its just very general. Less general than facebook, but fb has just became too general for the new times\nPersona: you post updates about what you do, about your interests, show off some aesthetic you capture, show off the imagine of yourself you are creating, show your hobbies maybe, show your personality in reel, photos, stories\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: is it a job\nFriend: a horse or what\nPersona: I think she is just missing having something to do with horses. She mentioned that getting a horse in denmark would be too expensive for her. So maybe a job?\nPersona: I dont really know her, I just promised I will ask you if there is something relevant for her to reach out to you, cause I know you have a horse business\nPersona: Hey vic, you reveived the email and fowarded it right? We are a bit worried, cause on our sent mailbox it does not appear\nPersona: Vic, the cbs email is kinda broken, the email was sitting in our 'outbox' for whole day and refused to be sent.\nPersona: Can you just somehow inform Cecilia of this\nPersona: Dear Cecilia, \n\n \n\nwe have a few more interview questions that would greatly improve our study and we would be very thankful for you to answer them. If you don\u2019t have time to answer them in writing, feel free to just record it \u2013 we will transcribe it :)\n\n \n\nCreativity: How was the quality of ideas generated on brainstorming tasks affected by COVID?\n\n \n\nConflict: How were interpersonal incompatibilities, resulting in tension and friction, affected by COVID?\n\n \n\nGroupthink: Are members willing to share their opinion (i.e. vote) for options that are against common group consensus? How did it change during COVID?\n\n \n\nCohesion: Was it more or less difficult to align members for a common goal during COVID?\n\nWhen we say affected by COVID we are referring to before, during and after COVID. \n\n Happy new year and thank you so much\nFriend: I will but she will not answer before at least tomorrow bc she has work and the whole stable (20 horse) alone today\nPersona: Ugh, I wish the email arrived yesterday\nFriend: ik but she probably wouldn\u2019t have answered it then anyways\nPersona: The first interview is lacking the whole 5 parts for culture, so analyzing it from these questions would produce weak points. Lets hope she answers asap \ud83d\ude4f\nPersona: I will read the new one you sent now\nPersona: Appreciate it\nPersona: Victoria, for the leadership part there is one point, where I refer that DE team memebrs mental issues were a cultrip to creativity. I omit the part that they solved that with leadership initiatives, on which you can build on. I mentioned your name in one of the comments from that argument in the Synopsis document.\nPersona: Also if we have 3+1 pages for analysis, the +1 being the extra one we did not allocate, and knowledge part taking 1 page, culture part taking 1.75 - 2 pages, try to somehow not exceed 1 page. Then we can keep all of the three theories.\nFriend: i will try\nFriend: Hi Airi\nFriend: how are you doing with CF\nPersona: hey, just sort of a thought about all the question and most of them seem clear. Will start cracking soon\nPersona: How about you?\nFriend: okay that\u2019s good\nFriend: i really think it\u2019s hard\nFriend: like some of it i just really don\u2019t know\nPersona: we will have a call with marcus tommorow to discuss, if you want you can join\nFriend: yeaahhh\nFriend: i would love that\nPersona: Okay I still dont know when, I just started working on it myself now haha\nPersona: procrastinated so long\nPersona: watched all the reels\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nPersona: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nPersona: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nPersona: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nPersona: Also\nPersona: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nPersona: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nPersona: This could be huge\nPersona: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nPersona: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nPersona: thats what I lvoe\nPersona: love*\nPersona: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nPersona: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nFriend: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nPersona: no worries I was also slow\nPersona: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\nPersona: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\nFriend: And also one in the evening, right?\nPersona: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\nPersona: I literally cant find the email\nFriend: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nPersona: yeah I agree\nFriend: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nPersona: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nPersona: my dear love is rejecting me\nPersona: I think should be not\nFriend: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\nFriend: about idea 1 and 2, right?\nFriend: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: oh yeah, I even tried for 20 mins to merge danish and english subtitles into one\nPersona: but in the end didn;t work out cause all of the danish subtitles I found (which were basically same subs, but reuploaded) were very badly made and out of sync.\nPersona: 1-2 dreams per year??? Like just simple ones, not lucid?\nPersona: that is so low\nPersona: did you again dodge an invitation to do something in real life? \ud83d\ude44\nPersona: I may need to do you ritual tommorow, its monthly friday bar at work, but this time its a special one cause one of the better collueages has his birthday.\nPersona: and my company is really social. like it's too social for me\nPersona: have any tips on doing the ritual at work?\nFriend: this looks like an oldschoold perm dryer\nFriend: give it a few months and you'll be able to do it yourself\nFriend: it is. I only realized that while I was thinking about that lucid dream thing\nFriend: I don't really miss much. I do have a vivid imagination\nFriend: oopsie sorry, that one was accidental. I was focused on the sword art, and didn't even realize\nFriend: I guess I've mastered the art of people dodgeball a bit too well\nFriend: hm back at the hospital I used to go to the trip room (the room where we put patients after giving them psychedelics). it had a bed and everything. very nice\nFriend: so my advice would be - find the trip room\nPersona: u have a trip room there xddd\nFriend: we sure do\nFriend: even stayed there overnight once\nFriend: sadly not tripping\nPersona: yeah, its a pretty trivial part of life. But sometimes its interesting what your mind puts you into, especially when it chooses peolple\nPersona: Just today I can recall 2 dreams I head\nPersona: neither fun, neither nightmares. More less fun than fun, I think I save myself in nightmare situations by just dealing with them. I never dream of the cliche demons, etc.\nPersona: My most common nightmare is brake not working on a car\nPersona: and the inteteresting thing is that everytime it happens, the car is going slow, usually in a parking lot and i am freaked out of denting someone elses car and mostlt having an awkward situation\nPersona: idk id I should try to understand its meaning\nPersona: if*\nPersona: you sure did\nPersona: Does the hospital give out free psychadelics, or what tha hell? Please explain!\nPersona: Also I imagined the room way different\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nFriend: Probably a good Idea\nFriend: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nPersona: He is platforms dude\nFriend: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nPersona: from him?\nPersona: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nPersona: but not on the other 2 I gues\nFriend: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nPersona: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nPersona: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nPersona: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nPersona: cause if not we should get looking\nPersona: perhaps\nPersona: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nPersona: we showed we are serious and won him\nFriend: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nFriend: true\nPersona: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nPersona: Dude\nPersona: I just found the term for idea one I think\nPersona: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nFriend: sounds accurate\nPersona: wait a sec\nPersona: I'll show you some gold\nPersona: read the yellow parts'ishg\nPersona: literally 100% what we were talking about\nFriend: U did it again!\nFriend: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\nPersona: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just did a month ago. Few people got salary increases, yet I asked for a really fat raise, as a part-timer, and they had to pay me, I made it clear I was not fooling around\nFriend: 1st lol. I never dared to try\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies."

And that messes with my perception\nPersona: So like gf, you are not sure\nPersona: And as a friend (normal), she is nice?\nPersona: Its a weird case, does that bothet you a lot?\nPersona: If thats the only problem for gf, then maybe see if this messing with your perception goes away\nFriend: don't think i can stop my head from remembering the other person soon\n\nThink I need more social confirmation and if others like her, then I'd trust that more than myself\nFriend: feeling stupid \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Okay get that social confirmation. I think she has a pretty likeable personality, she seems honest. Looks wise she is not the hottest chick, but in terms of intelligence its a rare find.\nPersona: from my point of view\nFriend: social confirmation received\nPersona: well you should get more\nPersona: if you want to trust it more than yourself\nFriend: I'm having huge confirmation bias now because I see it the same way\nFriend: don't know a girl that I can get an opinion from that I can trust with taht\nPersona: Maybe because we see women in similar way. But ask someone else too if you need more thoughts\nPersona: hmmm. Maybe Luiza?\nFriend: need to be super careful with analyzing her answer because she is always positive :DD\nPersona: or idk maybe even go with the flow, keep looking for other girls. I mean if you need so much of opinions what do others think about it, then maybe you are just forcing yourself to like her. When you actually like/love a girl, it shows clearly.\nFriend: I wonder how her brother would think because he was very religious and has a pure take sometimes\n\nbut honestly don't really want to know. Feel like the only social approval I need is my parents xD\nPersona: Lol I do also seek approval from my dad secretely\nPersona: but he has old fashioned perception of woman\nPersona: holy shit yesterday I had crazy experience\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: wish I clould do the same in R\nPersona: cause the web anaconda IDE is ehhh\nFriend: R markdown looks like Jupiter notebooks but it's not so convenient\nPersona: jupyter i mean*\nFriend: Can do in r studio\nFriend: Lookup\nR markdown\nPersona: well, markdown is markdown xd\nPersona: oh\nPersona: R Markdown\nPersona: I get it, I used it a bit\nPersona: but if you dont know how to have R notebooks in Vs Code, then idk if you can help me\nPersona: Is burlesque related to bdsm?\nPersona: chat gone chineese\nPersona: Vaping promotes reflection and ideas for me\nPersona: I take breaks to vape and listen to music for 5-10 minds and I have found that:\n1) I often think of some creative ideas for ongoing or new projects\n2) I think about tasks at hand from an inactive, relaxed and distance perspective, which gives me new ideas for solutions\n3) I feel happy and confident about myself\nPersona: This is a dangerous discovery which I dont know how to act upon\nPersona: Ughh, the bikes are not as cheap. Hard to find a decent one lower than 800kr\nPersona: I am starting to think about giving repair a retry. But the more I wait, the more I spend on bus.\nPersona: ahhhh, I spend more energy thinking about it than it would cost money equivalent (perhaps)\nPersona: Idk if DYI is always a good strat\nPersona: I like DYI cause I would learn stuff, but its something quite trivial to learn, idk will it be worth later in life.\nPersona: And I better focus on my top impact agenda\nFriend: nice moral dilemma you discovered there\n\nafraid of the addictive qualities but happy with the positive effects\nFriend: Just tried the coolest can opening mechanisn\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: why reply tho?\nPersona: how does it work?\nFriend: hahaha \nthat's the most retarded thing you must have seen xD\nI replied because I wrote something but I guess it didn't go through with the picture\nFriend: I think it's a good dilemma you have there\nFriend: imo if you can control yourself kind of, it's a good thing\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: 01.03\nFriend: But I think I\u2019m coming on 28.02\nFriend: And staying for the weekend\nFriend: So if you wanna hang out \ud83e\udd20\nFriend: Tbh I don\u2019t remember any people from the last FED. But I\u2019m hoping for some good networking this time\nPersona: lol, this is always a conindicene, you land on my exam data. bu this one finished exactly on 28th so good\nPersona: date*\nFriend: \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\nFriend: Had a dream with you lol\nPersona: girafes. Definetely my kind of zoo\nPersona: The randomness is very dream like indeed \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Noted\nPersona: xd\nPersona: what us that supposed to mean haha\nPersona: shoould I epect a giraffe delivered to my door soon? xd\nFriend: I can get you one for birthday\nPersona: if the giraffe would be in a form of a bath towel, that would be wonderful gift\nFriend: Are you for real?\nFriend: Be careful\nFriend: I take stuff like this seriously\nFriend: Xd\nPersona: Its 4 ryl\nPersona: for real*\nPersona: It's for real.\nFriend: 1000%?\nFriend: Good that I know your size and adress lol\nFriend: Eazy\nPersona: Just this morning I was thinking that I need more good bathtowels\nFriend: Btw, do you have any birthday plans?\nPersona: not yet\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: hm. I honestly dont know their argument on a deeper level. Never actually though why exatxly equality in pay should be there. I just took that it 'should' be equal. The issues are not only in pay though. Like the number.of women.in CEO positions, etc. - the way they are looked upon I guess\nPersona: I made my statement xddd\nFriend: thats the one that doesnt want to go out?\nPersona: we went out once 5 meters\nPersona: she came to my room\nPersona: she lives just above me\nPersona: we had a good chill time\nPersona: In my personal finance system I made a feature so I can take a virtual loan for myself. I have those jars with money for specific purposes and I spend more than there is in them. So to make a bigger purchases, I didn't have completely enough in my jar, so I just made a loan jar with negative balance and transfered some money from there. Then I made so when my income comes, some money that is supposed to go to the jar, will go to the loan jar to eventually in two months fill the negative balance back to 0.\nPersona: And my collateral is my SECURE jar, which the total loan amount must not exceed.\nPersona: And the best part is that I give myself interest free loans xd\nPersona: Hows the vape though? Got hooked yet?\nFriend: no\nIt's real good\n\nI did a puff last night and did one tonight\nPersona: :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\nPersona: You did one puff a day?\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: savoring it\nPersona: how cute\nFriend: :DD\nPersona: its like saying I ate on chip from a bag of chips a day\nFriend: xDDD\nFriend: you did that with the spicy one tho!!\nPersona: Oh yeah I did\nPersona: it was more like 5 -8  chips\nFriend: we got some nuts machine we can use in the first campus we studied beit\nFriend: I went today to see it\nFriend: they have extension for them\nFriend: can engrave on cylinders or cones with them\nFriend: on glass\nstainless steel\nPersona: damm man, kick-off a brand\nPersona: while you have access\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ran out of credits before I can make a big ass image\nFriend: now for the story\nFriend: Have any friends that do writing?\nI have one dude I think that does poetry. Wanna contact and see if we can collab :D\nPersona: you make this?\nPersona: XDDDD\nFriend: i make dis :DD\n\nI just tell it words and it makes paintings\nPersona: connect the AIs\nFriend: each square is 1024x1024\nFriend: so this picture was getting over 4k\nFriend: 3k maybe, not 4\nPersona: A bunch but all lithuanian\nPersona: I stopped being artsy in dk\nFriend: yea.. im still like wtf\n\nthis is life changing\nFriend: for so many people\n\nlike story telling and illustrations\nFriend: you dont have to pay an illustrator now\nFriend: can do it yourself when you have a story\nPersona: also you dont neeed to know how to do art\nPersona: trying to stand out more to employeers on linked in\nPersona: xddd\nPersona: which is true story\nPersona: what do you think about the copywriting also? xd\nFriend: did you do the post with the AI :DD\nFriend: I already like dit\n\nits good I guess\nFriend: I can't get myself to do posts like that yet\nPersona: thanks\nPersona: actually only now I finally understood the CDO CDS and how that caused the crisis\nPersona: Got inspired by corporate finance lectures, so did some AI questioning, then watched the scene from the big short\nFriend: which part was eye opening\nPersona: it was a topic about risk mangement and derivatives\nPersona: and man, in one of the past exams there was one insane questions with options, where you have to plot (sketch) the profits vs stock price when combining 4 optioms\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Actually I have this theory, that the almost a century developed digital graphics and the more recent digital VR technology curve will be disrupted by dreaming based experiences. Brain can simulate a full dive virtual reality natively, while we are currently struggling with expensive and barely realistic haptic suits, limited field of view, etc.\nPersona: ugh I have this course now called Research Methods and its basically a course about academia. I don't think I am made for this haha \ud83d\ude2b\nFriend: nej, in the article you linked there's an X post from that company, and it contains a 10 min vid where the CEO explains what the deal is\nFriend: nono, that ultrasound brain stimulation technique\nFriend: seems like lucid dreaming could have some potential for PTSD treatment though, I've noticed quite a few articles about it, but haven't read. for this reason it would be really cool for a device like this to exist, but I think the aim here is commercial use, which I'm not the fan of\nFriend: I've been thinking about it a lot for the past few days actually haha\nFriend: you know what, I think you'd like it. I also need to rewatch it sometime because I haven't seen the last season and I don't remember what happened by that  point, but I just need to commit to waste of 40h of my life I'm never going to get back. haven't come to terms with it yet\nFriend: ah okay yes, it does ring a bell\nFriend: what movie?\nFriend: oh I'm so with you on this one. thogh it's sad because even lucid dreaming wouldn't give you that experience. you'd only sense your own idea of what a life like this would look like\nFriend: it does sound probable. but as a neuro person the prospect scares me a lot\nFriend: what are your research methods? because based on the business papers I've read, you just do A LOT of polls and stuff\nPersona: ahh, I will watch it in abit\nPersona: okay, I really need to watch it then, because now I imagine you having a huge ultrasound brain stimulation throne in your room, but I am sure its not that haha\nPersona: ahh you are very kind again with your altruistic intentions. I am thinking about it purely for entertainment, gaming purposes xd\nPersona: commerical use is not bad, money drives research too\nPersona: but have you ever had a lucid dream?\nPersona: Adams Applies, a 2005 danish film\nPersona: If somebody explained me what it was about, I would probably never watch it, since it turned out to be somewhat religion related and had far-fetched aspects, but I ended up enjoying it quite a lot. The characters in the movie are very unique and interesting, it has an absurd there throughout it and it's an unusual darker comedy, where the movie does not explicitly tell you when to laugh - often I laughed and then thought \"That was funny right? or wait, is thats not funny at all?\"\nPersona: the religion connection to it I think was quite optional since I know nothing about it and still enjoyed the movie\nPersona: The whole movie was about a neo-nazi baking an apple pie.\nPersona: yeah, but perhaps we will find a way to stream perceptions to our sleeping minds. Something like NerveGear from Sword Art Online (if you know)\nPersona: fack, I now watch a video about Sword art online and then Cyberpunk and now I want to play video games.. ugh\nPersona: We have just finalized our topics choice and its most likely going to be qualitative. Overall, I never did any exam at CBS with polls, but I know many people did for this one lecture that I mentioned. Usually, we do qualitative in our exams, except for the data science one, where we trained a neural network to predict real estate prices.\nPersona: I don't have the same impression, often its studies multiple case studies of companies\nPersona: tv series being long overall and usually inflated to have more eps really annoy me. But I guess some are too good, you have to take the cost. I am down to watch Peaky Blinders from time to time, or maybe if you are into anime, then maaaaybe sword art online, since now I remembered it xd\nFriend: uh oh, thought you've seen it. apologies for the spoilers then\nFriend: haha this seems like an euphemism for an electric chair\nFriend: this would not end well I think. form an ethical perspective\nFriend: oh wow, are you that committed to practising Danish?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: img actually shows when you finish editing that piece\nFriend: thats good\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: the matrix thingy is from a plugin, so its looks a bit unsexy by default, eespecially with the embed\nPersona: but I am sure a few lines of CSS can fix it\nPersona: u can have borders in kanban too\nPersona: most of the things here are this one OP plugin that I found, thats why I got so lit up\nPersona: So its not perfect at places\nPersona: but Logseq is cool without this plugin too. I like the two way embeds so much. They were my eternal complain in mindmanager, as they didn't exist\nFriend: what if there is a circular reference \nwill it be infinite note\nFriend: but that's really cool!\nFriend: and what are the motivational quotes that show up :D that's neat\nFriend: can't be CTO before you become coder! xD\nPersona: yeah, then it will be infinite loop xd\nPersona: I think it tried once, i dont remember what happened\nPersona: yeah, anything hashtag #quote will eventually show up\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: impressive setup\nFriend: can't wait to clean my room\n\nand then I want logseq!\nPersona: I think you will love it\nPersona: might be hard to love at first, but once you tame it\nPersona: Literally spent whole day writing this statement of purpose and I am yet to be done\nPersona: Either I am unproductive, or either I am unproductive or either I set the bar too high for this task\nFriend: important task\nget it done good\n\nI'll go write mine too\nFriend: had food\nhad nap\nhad game\nready now\nPersona: its 22:50 PM\nPersona: now is overstatement\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: if you have time, can I ask you for a proofread\nPersona: It reads quite smooth\nI think your points match the information systems type of student well.\nNot sure if its worth mentioning the MIO guest student part. I think since you took electives for a whole semester and are doing Digital Business there now, you can conclude/show the same points from these parts. I dont think its bad to have it, but instead, I would cut it and illustrate a few points you made with examples, stories. Something sounding more personal and unique, more you. Perhaps a story from metro? And think that few detailed, unique, clearly personal example is better than many abstractions.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: lol\nPersona: thats overthinking at its finest\nFriend: Cause maybe i am and colleagues pitty me and give me a win for the competition\nFriend: I did the math. Its more likely\nPersona: this is a reddit post. \n\nI though I am retarded because I guessed a 1/400 random number\nPersona: oh\nPersona: in that way\nPersona: but why out of pity?\nFriend: Wanna bike the holiday?\nIm taking the dino for a ride maybe\nFriend: Cause im retarded\nFriend: M3 line has a QR code hunt\nAnd then you get free choco bunny and a chance to win some museum tickets\nPersona: wait I am in shower xd\nPersona: okay, but i dont think you are retarded\nPersona: at most you are a little bit childish, but I dont think colleagues would mind that\nPersona: I am in portugal man\nPersona: or what day you are talking about?\nFriend: You're where :o\nFriend: Good to hear xD cause that gif is how ive been feeling today\nFriend: Friday saturday sunday monday \nWhatever\nFriend: They have it to monday including\nPersona: yeah bro, I am on a cbs surf trip \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I am back on Monday\nFriend: Holy moly nice\nAnd short sleeve? Good weather \ud83d\ude01\nFriend: Enjoy! I'll see you when you're back then\nFriend: That sand loooks goood\nFriend: Wanna step bare feet\nLooks soft\nPersona: yeah today is good\nPersona: sometimes a bit windy\nPersona: 17-23 at the hot time of day\nFriend: did you see this\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching"

They were my eternal complain in mindmanager, as they didn't exist\nFriend: what if there is a circular reference \nwill it be infinite note\nFriend: but that's really cool!\nFriend: and what are the motivational quotes that show up :D that's neat\nFriend: can't be CTO before you become coder! xD\nPersona: yeah, then it will be infinite loop xd\nPersona: I think it tried once, i dont remember what happened\nPersona: yeah, anything hashtag #quote will eventually show up\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: impressive setup\nFriend: can't wait to clean my room\n\nand then I want logseq!\nPersona: I think you will love it\nPersona: might be hard to love at first, but once you tame it\nPersona: Literally spent whole day writing this statement of purpose and I am yet to be done\nPersona: Either I am unproductive, or either I am unproductive or either I set the bar too high for this task\nFriend: important task\nget it done good\n\nI'll go write mine too\nFriend: had food\nhad nap\nhad game\nready now\nPersona: its 22:50 PM\nPersona: now is overstatement\nPersona: xdd\nFriend: if you have time, can I ask you for a proofread\nPersona: It reads quite smooth\nI think your points match the information systems type of student well.\nNot sure if its worth mentioning the MIO guest student part. I think since you took electives for a whole semester and are doing Digital Business there now, you can conclude/show the same points from these parts. I dont think its bad to have it, but instead, I would cut it and illustrate a few points you made with examples, stories. Something sounding more personal and unique, more you. Perhaps a story from metro? And think that few detailed, unique, clearly personal example is better than many abstractions.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\nPersona: here\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\nFriend: Catchy\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1. Something you want to save up money to spend. The Shoes.\n2. Ways in which you can weekly save money. Don't order take-out today/this week.\nPersona: So it can be quite confusing. But calling the 2nd a 'step' then sort of a forces to have some goal too. But if we can have some different naming...\nPersona: we can also discus this tmmrow\nFriend: Ok I\u2019ll think about it\nFriend: can some of u remember what the more detailed background for \"indifferent\" means in this table\nFriend: bc i am trying to describe the customers further using this and indifferent would not work bc it does not really tell anything so maybe its the same as not interested in PF?\nFriend: I think we should have it be 2 scenarios that users can choose and change from at any given time. Not sure how well it works if they run at the same time \n\n1. original idea \n2. your idea\n\nHowever, I think there should only be 2 elements to it because otherwise it becomes inconsistent imo\n\nSo Goal > daily nudges \n\nName idea for daily nudges could be \u201ddaily-dos\u201c\nFriend: Yeah I think indifferent means they just don\u2019t care\nFriend: Or yes-ification instead of notification\nPersona: It sounds like the same\nPersona: yesification xdddd\nPersona: what is original idea and your idea?\nFriend: This is yours\nPersona: I think daily nudges is fine. Cause some ways to save mainly consists of don't. So daily-do's would limit the kind of nudges we can have.\nPersona: Whats the original?\nPersona: Without the goal?\nFriend: The initial think we talked about today. Where you can choose a weekly goal based on the multi-select question\nFriend: But then we have to decide if we want that to be a circle that reoccurs every week or how\nPersona: The 'change of scenarios' then should not be like a switch-button. If you don't set \"adidas shoes' goal', Then you are in scenario \"Original idea\". If you do set 'adidas shoes' goal, then you are in \"Your idea\" scenario. What do you think about that?\nFriend: so then i feel like being lazy and not into personla finance are kin dof in the same space as well bc they would take up a lot of people then.... I would make more sense to write that people are lazy and not into doing their personal finances rather than they dont care abt right? or am i fishing\nPersona: But the reason I am saying 'adidas shoes' goal is because there is a disambiguity between the two types of goals we are talking about. This is what I mean that we need to invest different words for that.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: So you done 22\nDo you wanna join sankt hans or no?\nFriend: Friday 23\nPersona: I finish work after 17, then I do to Silvan, after that I am free\nFriend: For stuff? Im home atm\nMaybe we go tofetber\nFriend: 22 i meant the day\nFriend: Cause you sais you busy\nPersona: yYeah I understood\nPersona: I am busy until 2023-06-22\nFriend: Sankt hans on 2023-06-23 \nI think\nPersona: thats my plan for 23rd\nPersona: So if its after idk, maybe 20:00 hours I can join\nFriend: Aah\nFriend: Yeah!\nFriend: Lets do that together then! Silvan then fires\nFriend: I wanna join for shoppnig\nPersona: yeah, sounds good\nFriend: 2 extend the offer to mons klint group\nFriend: Ill*\nFriend: Or try to see what Sam Laura need\nKnow if arijan needs?\nPersona: idk, he didnt say anything\nPersona: will ask, or you can in the group\nFriend: I saw we talked in group but no one said what they have or need\nSo ill dm them\nPersona: okay thx\nPersona: fucking hell bro, this group assignment is in deep trouble, my peers just really rushed it, somethings of what they wrote make minimal sense or add no value whatsoever. They are there just to include a reference to satisfy teachers, but it will just make them mad\nPersona: She studies MSc information systems in CBS and we met cause I asked if she could share her xp with that course\nPersona: That was only one opinion, but it seemed like this course at CBS not what I want because its too non-technical, the actual coding you do is same as BSc level we did at Digital Managment. Its mostly management stuff, but she hardly applied it at her work as a scrum master in Orsted, where she manages IT system dev.\nPersona: I can tell you more about it if you are contemplating this program, but today I almost fully decided that I am not taking MSc IS\nPersona: But we talked a bunch about ITU and ITU actually seems like a place. At ITU they really do and learn shit. She said what we learned in whole year for programming at CBS, that was like 1mo at ITU. She said at ITU you have no life.\nPersona: Which I like, because what we learn at CBS is ehhh, you can be very lazy and still pass. Its about the connections and the brand where CBS is nice.\nPersona: I think I will look more into Software Architect, that actually might be a good place to be for me. But that's not at CBS prob.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think\nFriend: Ok\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\nPersona: and this for a joke\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\nPersona: here\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\nFriend: Catchy\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1. Something you want to save up money to spend. The Shoes.\n2. Ways in which you can weekly save money. Don't order take-out today/this week.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nPersona: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nPersona: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nPersona: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nPersona: Also\nPersona: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nPersona: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nPersona: This could be huge\nPersona: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nPersona: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nPersona: thats what I lvoe\nPersona: love*\nPersona: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nPersona: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nFriend: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nPersona: no worries I was also slow\nPersona: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\nPersona: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\nFriend: And also one in the evening, right?\nPersona: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\nPersona: I literally cant find the email\nFriend: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nPersona: yeah I agree\nFriend: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nPersona: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nPersona: my dear love is rejecting me\nPersona: I think should be not\nFriend: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\nFriend: about idea 1 and 2, right?\nFriend: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: interesting how they hide it\nPersona: luckily they didn't do that I guess\nFriend: oh so you modified the css on their page permanently kinda\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: to allow copy link to work\nFriend: nice\nPersona: I've been using this featue so much now\nPersona: Cause i just hate some stupid anti-productive web designs\nFriend: seems like they don't disallow embedding outside of their domain\nFriend: idk why they did that..\nFriend: it's anti feature\nFriend: when do you need the url to the img?\nPersona: yeah, it works. I add images to my notes like that, when I don't mind them getting removed years after\nFriend: why reference to the image and not the image itself?\nPersona: adding images to markdown usually, so I can send the notes to my classmate without the images separetely\nPersona: Because if I add the image locally, it is stored not in the .md file\nFriend: yeah\nPersona: this makes the image be 'stored' in the .md file. Good for sharing notes\nPersona: Also free image hosting heheheeh\nFriend: ah so logseq the md one\n\ndidn't allow live collaboration \nI didn't like that\n\nand markdown not that flexible/easy as the custom elements of notion\nFriend: but maybe the good features are real good\nyou gotta show me the power\nPersona: Yeah Logseq, Obsidian and almost all code editors don't allow live collaboration. That sucks\nPersona: But I need it only in rare cases\nPersona: For markdown. I much much rather prefer markdown. It is super extensive, you own all your data, its future proof, cause you can easily switch to any other .md note system (like Obsidian, Roam)\nPersona: md is like html in a way. It makes the structure. Then CSS and JS does the magic\nPersona: Can have kanbans n shit\nPersona: well this is not a kanban, but I don't have a kanban arm\nPersona: these #.v-eisenhower-matrix like custom classes, that if I type without `` marks, applies custom styling\nFriend: no way\nPersona: for example this tag here I can make an image gallery be put in a matrix of my choice\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: out of all\nPersona: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\nPersona: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\nPersona: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\nFriend: Will do now\nFriend: U didn't check Rony's mail?\nFriend: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\nFriend: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\nFriend: What is that 1 called?\nFriend: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\nFriend: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\nFriend: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\nPersona: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\nPersona: see*\nFriend: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\nPersona: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\nPersona: and fully through DIGI\nPersona: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\nPersona: no need, I give you a summary\nPersona: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\nPersona: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\nFriend: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\nFriend: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\nPersona: but do we really need more than already mapped?\nPersona: Did we send massages to them\nPersona: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\nPersona: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\nFriend: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\nFriend: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\nFriend: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I don't like page based, because a big task in note-taking is deciding where to put what and then deciding where to look for what. If you also need to think about pages, then its an extra variable in your decision making process.\nPersona: Logseq automates that, so any single block can be a page, you just press on it to zoom in and it becomes the root element\nPersona: But they also have pages (which is sometimes till needed so files don't get too large and if you want to collaborate, so you can work in diff files, like in coding)\nPersona: The only issue with Logseq is that its less stable and feels a little weirder and less polished than Obsidian. Obsidian is super smooth\nPersona: Next semester I will try switching uni notes to Logseq, but I am a little anxious. There will be many improvements with that - like I can't wait till I can use block embeds, also I will be able to share my notes with other people in a standardized format. Search functionality is better too.\nPersona: But I am anxious that the mindmap layout presentation will turn out to be much more superior to bullet list presentation when it comes to complex topics I will study. Also in Logseq there is less options for content visual customization, so making things standout is more limited (bolding, colors still work).\nPersona: bruuug sweet\nPersona: you look good\nFriend: Thanks man\nWas a good time\nFriend: I'm happy she wants to show me\nFriend: Was thinking some days before that ppl post on diff social media diff side of them and was wondering if she will just want her own photos on instagram\nFriend: Or would she show me\nFriend: Cause ive heard a lot instagram is more for dating kind of\nFriend: What are block embeds\nFriend: Yeah.. i want some way to combine mindmanager mindmaps with note app\nPersona: ig is general purpose social media\nPersona: i dont think it has much specialization like linkedin which is for professionals\nPersona: almost everykind of businness has ig profile these days\nPersona: I think instsgram is good for dating, but its the same as saying 'a car is good for dating'. Ita good but its not made for it specifically\nPersona: You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. \n\nobj_A = Object()\n\nobj_A.var1 = \"hello\"\nobj_A2 = obj_A\nobj_A2.var1 = \"world\"\nprint(obj_A.var1) // \"world\"\nPersona: thats prob best way to explain it\nPersona: its like a mirror reference thats editable\nPersona: mindmanager is so bad for integrations\nFriend: They have that?\n\nWhere does the real obj live\nIs one original and other are references\nFriend: Huh\nYoutube-like?\nFriend: But with photos\nPersona: I will show you later\nPersona: bro do you really have no idea how instragram is used?\nPersona: Its not like youtube in many ways. Its just very general. Less general than facebook, but fb has just became too general for the new times\nPersona: you post updates about what you do, about your interests, show off some aesthetic you capture, show off the imagine of yourself you are creating, show your hobbies maybe, show your personality in reel, photos, stories\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: if my colleague can do it, you can do it\nPersona: you can definetely do it then\nPersona: you will learn to make a full-stack web application\nPersona: thats really cool\nPersona: when you have the million dollar app idea you will be able to do\nFriend: i dont even know what that iiisss\nFriend: i hope i will have a million dollar idea\nFriend: or do some cool cyber security shit\nFriend: thanks for the encouraging words\nPersona: actually, I though you are sad that you think you haven't chose the program that you most want\nPersona: but you did choose what you want\nFriend: i will go stressfully sleep now\nPersona: and now you are just pussying out\nPersona: I can tell you\nPersona: you should not regret challenging yourself\nFriend: i feel like it was a bit of a tie maybe when i level out the pros and cons but yeah\nFriend: it was the only one where i read it and thiught it was interesting for me\nFriend: true i will take it as a challenge\nPersona: what were the main cons and pros?\nFriend: i need to man up\nFriend: *woman up\nPersona: woman up\nFriend: and stop being a pussy\nPersona: no pussies allowed here\nPersona: where is the womaned up victoria that chose this course an hour ago?\nFriend: CF is a big con for MIB for me i hated that shit and also i felt like the courses didn\u2019t really get me excited \npro is that its more broad and might be a little \u201ceasier\u201d for me to do. Aaaand some more people applied to it\nPersona: can I just call you\nPersona: very lazy to type\nFriend: for DB the discriotiin and some of the classes seemed really nice. It gives me a more specialized profile and some knowledge that\u2019s more unique..  con is programming and it\u2019s harder and i feel alone haha\nFriend: true i mean i actually decided bc i didn\u2019t wanna be a bitch and go for the safer choice so i am really turning on a table here"

Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nFriend: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nPersona: no worries maan\nPersona: damn early bird, 06:16\nFriend: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nPersona: ohh ur going today\nPersona: this song is so good\nFriend: Smart way of learning Danish!\nFriend: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nFriend: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nPersona: Hey, looked at the email now\nPersona: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nPersona: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nPersona: He looks pretty old\nPersona: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nPersona: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nPersona: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nPersona: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nPersona: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nPersona: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nPersona: Also\nPersona: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nPersona: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nPersona: This could be huge\nPersona: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nPersona: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: wish I clould do the same in R\nPersona: cause the web anaconda IDE is ehhh\nFriend: R markdown looks like Jupiter notebooks but it's not so convenient\nPersona: jupyter i mean*\nFriend: Can do in r studio\nFriend: Lookup\nR markdown\nPersona: well, markdown is markdown xd\nPersona: oh\nPersona: R Markdown\nPersona: I get it, I used it a bit\nPersona: but if you dont know how to have R notebooks in Vs Code, then idk if you can help me\nPersona: Is burlesque related to bdsm?\nPersona: chat gone chineese\nPersona: Vaping promotes reflection and ideas for me\nPersona: I take breaks to vape and listen to music for 5-10 minds and I have found that:\n1) I often think of some creative ideas for ongoing or new projects\n2) I think about tasks at hand from an inactive, relaxed and distance perspective, which gives me new ideas for solutions\n3) I feel happy and confident about myself\nPersona: This is a dangerous discovery which I dont know how to act upon\nPersona: Ughh, the bikes are not as cheap. Hard to find a decent one lower than 800kr\nPersona: I am starting to think about giving repair a retry. But the more I wait, the more I spend on bus.\nPersona: ahhhh, I spend more energy thinking about it than it would cost money equivalent (perhaps)\nPersona: Idk if DYI is always a good strat\nPersona: I like DYI cause I would learn stuff, but its something quite trivial to learn, idk will it be worth later in life.\nPersona: And I better focus on my top impact agenda\nFriend: nice moral dilemma you discovered there\n\nafraid of the addictive qualities but happy with the positive effects\nFriend: Just tried the coolest can opening mechanisn\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: why reply tho?\nPersona: how does it work?\nFriend: hahaha \nthat's the most retarded thing you must have seen xD\nI replied because I wrote something but I guess it didn't go through with the picture\nFriend: I think it's a good dilemma you have there\nFriend: imo if you can control yourself kind of, it's a good thing\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nFriend: Probably a good Idea\nFriend: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nPersona: He is platforms dude\nFriend: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nPersona: from him?\nPersona: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nPersona: but not on the other 2 I gues\nFriend: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nPersona: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nPersona: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nPersona: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nPersona: cause if not we should get looking\nPersona: perhaps\nPersona: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nPersona: we showed we are serious and won him\nFriend: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nFriend: true\nPersona: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nPersona: Dude\nPersona: I just found the term for idea one I think\nPersona: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nFriend: sounds accurate\nPersona: wait a sec\nPersona: I'll show you some gold\nPersona: read the yellow parts'ishg\nPersona: literally 100% what we were talking about\nFriend: U did it again!\nFriend: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\nPersona: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think\nFriend: Ok\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\nPersona: and this for a joke\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\nPersona: here\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\nFriend: Catchy\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1. Something you want to save up money to spend. The Shoes.\n2. Ways in which you can weekly save money. Don't order take-out today/this week.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Lol nice\nFriend: Always slipping\n\nIts like ice skating shoes but for asphalt\nPersona: Xddd\nPersona: The artsyles prompt ideas are pretty cool though. And combining them is nice\nPersona: Good for making steam, forum avatars\nPersona: What do you use for notetaking?\nFriend: Notion is the shit imo\nFriend: Used it during internship\nFriend: Have a journal there\nFriend: And anything that has a time i try to immediately put in the calendar so i can keep track of life\nPersona: I been experimenting with notion for a while and idk, it does not stick to me\nPersona: Whole day I was researching note taking apps\nPersona: I feel it takes very long to make notes in Notion and having everything on many pages, things get lost and navigation takes time.\nPersona: Also I like the toggleable bullet list approach that MindManager for example uses\nPersona: Its hard for me to write in paragraph style\nPersona: I am experimenting with Obsidian and Logseq\nPersona: Obsidian is super cool, but its paragraph style\nPersona: Loqseq is bullet point style\nPersona: I watched note-taking, seconds brain apps for whole video and there was no mention of Mindmanager\nPersona: I might be too uses to it now, its really hard to switch. I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: nice\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\nPersona: yo wtf\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\nPersona: click the three dots\nPersona: and there is install app button\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: uh\nFriend: what\u2019s the idea\nFriend: it\u2019s so smart making startup in equine sports bc people are rich and want to spent all their coins in their horses\nPersona: is your app idea for rich people with horses also?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: yes\nFriend: also the poor ones\nFriend: but it might cater more to ambitious riders\nFriend: which means their probably have money\nPersona: okay next time lets talk about your billion dollar idea\nFriend: yeahhh\nPersona: We have this business idea for bite-sized finance goals. You get one goal every week to follow, which makes it easy and intuitive. NExt week is dfferent goal. Goals are curated by developers. Also the goals are personalized based on previous use. We may also intregreate receipt item data to even further personalize the goals. \n\nWhat kind of monetization techniques you would suggest?\nPersona: Hey Vic\nPersona: Can you do me a small favor?\nPersona: Can you give me a few danish Tik Tok influencers, ideally 20 - 100K followers, no more\nPersona: <3\nPersona: Cause I have no clue, where to start finding them haha\nFriend: yeah i\u2019ll be right on it haha\nPersona: \ud83e\udd70\nFriend: perfect for another task to do instead of studying\nFriend: does it count if he is american but makes tik toks about denmark\nFriend: and being danish\nPersona: The audience needs to be in denmark/copenhagen\nPersona: So if thats true, its good\nPersona: Nicceee thanks\nPersona: going through them now\nPersona: those are really good\nPersona: thank you vic\nFriend: great!

And that messes with my perception\nPersona: So like gf, you are not sure\nPersona: And as a friend (normal), she is nice?\nPersona: Its a weird case, does that bothet you a lot?\nPersona: If thats the only problem for gf, then maybe see if this messing with your perception goes away\nFriend: don't think i can stop my head from remembering the other person soon\n\nThink I need more social confirmation and if others like her, then I'd trust that more than myself\nFriend: feeling stupid \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Okay get that social confirmation. I think she has a pretty likeable personality, she seems honest. Looks wise she is not the hottest chick, but in terms of intelligence its a rare find.\nPersona: from my point of view\nFriend: social confirmation received\nPersona: well you should get more\nPersona: if you want to trust it more than yourself\nFriend: I'm having huge confirmation bias now because I see it the same way\nFriend: don't know a girl that I can get an opinion from that I can trust with taht\nPersona: Maybe because we see women in similar way. But ask someone else too if you need more thoughts\nPersona: hmmm. Maybe Luiza?\nFriend: need to be super careful with analyzing her answer because she is always positive :DD\nPersona: or idk maybe even go with the flow, keep looking for other girls. I mean if you need so much of opinions what do others think about it, then maybe you are just forcing yourself to like her. When you actually like/love a girl, it shows clearly.\nFriend: I wonder how her brother would think because he was very religious and has a pure take sometimes\n\nbut honestly don't really want to know. Feel like the only social approval I need is my parents xD\nPersona: Lol I do also seek approval from my dad secretely\nPersona: but he has old fashioned perception of woman\nPersona: holy shit yesterday I had crazy experience\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\nPersona: just baught another domain name\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\nFriend: just be mr beast\nPersona: nice actually\nPersona: cant risk watching\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but I do stand corrected. it may be kind of possible\nFriend: the technique is actually legit. recently used for mood improvement. pretty cool\nFriend: the lucid dream part is more tricky. seems that til now only 1 study from 2012 succesfully captured the difference between REM and lucid-REM. and they recruited 4 experienced lucid dreamers, and still only 1 had a lucid dream in the scanner lol + the activated network is pretty dispersed\nFriend: skimmed through a recent meta analysis. most attempts to induce lucid dreams failed. only in one with transcranial stimulation they had a mild effect, but only in experienced lucid dreamers. interestingly galantimine (AD medication) induced lucid dreams in 42% inexperienced people vs 17% in placebo group\nFriend: but feasibility aside, it seems a bit risky. we don't even fully understand what REM and dreams are for, but we do know that deficiency in REM is associated with increased death rate, so it's not sth I would really fuck with for funsies\nFriend: *oops galantamine and 14%, not 17%\nFriend: yup, soft d is a beauty. can kind of hear it, but no clue how to produce it\nFriend: I've seen quite a lot. strangely enough, not Breaking Bad. would say Peaky Blinders, Hannibal and Mr Robot are my top 3. fairly recently I've watched Succession and also loved it\nFriend: woah why is this so specific? are you referencing something?\ud83d\ude33\nPersona: which vid are you reffering to, the academia pyramid one?\nPersona: Lucid dreaming? You can do it often?\nPersona: damn you went to the rabbit hole\nPersona: I merely skimmed, the article and sent it, cause I thought it would interest you, and here we go, Joanna at 2 AM haha\nPersona: be careful not to miss your REM sleep, I swear, someone just literally told me it can lead to increased death rate\nPersona: Peaky Blinders were always on my watch it, but I never watched it\nPersona: its meta programming. I think among the top expensive programming errors included a mid-air space rocket explosion. If I remember it correctly it was because someone mixed up imperial and metric units \ud83d\udc40\nPersona: but I invented the part with strongly typed language, but I am sure typos have also lead to some other expensive errors\nPersona: Actually, I just watched a movie and thought about lucid dreaming. Its really cool that a brain can simulate a world in you mind with actual senses and when one can guide what happens in the world, its even better\nPersona: I only lucid dream a few times, but I noticed, that yes, I can control what happens in the dream, but I can't invent new real knowledge, it's simply just physically impossible. If I try to travel to a place I never been or experience something I never did, the parts of that experience that I have experienced in real life will be simulated, but parts that I never will sort of a try to be substituted, combined, imagines with existing experiences that I have had. It really sort of reminds me how AI and neural networks work\nPersona: And I thought about it right now, because having 1 life in the present is god damn limiting. I am sometimes fascinated by different cultures, like I always wondered what it would be like to be true punk ahahah, life fuck education, career and just live a punk life, One can't really 'try it out', you have to give it a lot of life. And then I even went into the extremes of being curious what a life experience of a skinhead in 60s - 90s would be like. I am just curious to experience it without consequences to the real world\nPersona: Actually I have this theory, that the almost a century developed digital graphics and the more recent digital VR technology curve will be disrupted by dreaming based experiences. Brain can simulate a full dive virtual reality natively, while we are currently struggling with expensive and barely realistic haptic suits, limited field of view, etc.\nPersona: ugh I have this course now called Research Methods and its basically a course about academia. I don't think I am made for this haha \ud83d\ude2b\nFriend: nej, in the article you linked there's an X post from that company, and it contains a 10 min vid where the CEO explains what the deal is\nFriend: nono, that ultrasound brain stimulation technique\nFriend: seems like lucid dreaming could have some potential for PTSD treatment though, I've noticed quite a few articles about it, but haven't read. for this reason it would be really cool for a device like this to exist, but I think the aim here is commercial use, which I'm not the fan of\nFriend: I've been thinking about it a lot for the past few days actually haha\nFriend: you know what, I think you'd like it. I also need to rewatch it sometime because I haven't seen the last season and I don't remember what happened by that  point, but I just need to commit to waste of 40h of my life I'm never going to get back. haven't come to terms with it yet\nFriend: ah okay yes, it does ring a bell\nFriend: what movie?\nFriend: oh I'm so with you on this one. thogh it's sad because even lucid dreaming wouldn't give you that experience. you'd only sense your own idea of what a life like this would look like\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: they go a bit down\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\nPersona: i cant conceive\nPersona: it this a wall\nPersona: is*\nFriend: the little bricks\nFriend: wanted to jump from top to bottom\nPersona: Ohhh ehaaaat\nPersona: so the image is satelite\nPersona: wtffff\nPersona: WTF IS THIS PICTURE BRO\nPersona: its cursed\nFriend: hahah i google mapsd it\nFriend: lol\nPersona: its like half satelite half normal\nPersona: but i got it\nPersona: sounds funny\nFriend: yeh so far ok\nwe see if we can handle differences :D\nFriend: im a bit scared if she changes how she feels cause she enthusiastic atm\n\nalso she wants to travel countries \n\nso I'm a bit scared cause I don't want much\nPersona: I think you are the type of person who can handle differences well\nPersona: dont want cause not enjoy it much or other reason?\nFriend: yeh\nI haven't felt I got my moneys worth from the trip\nFriend: if I was networking or meeting people like you did on the Poland trip and I felt active \n\nit would be different probably\nPersona: trips generally? or some in particular?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\nPersona: okay\nPersona: no worries haha\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: They neee to think ita serious\nPersona: problem that they may still choke and die from placebos, cause they would need to drink when lying\nFriend: what I get out of this is that the lack of snacks must've been a significant issue at Lithuanian parties once upon a time. you all are angry about that to this day\nFriend: soo in a perfect world you would like to test the impact of each factor, because you don't know if all are significant or not\nFriend: but as you can imagine cost wise and statistically it would really suck so no one does studies this complex\nFriend: what do you mean they need to think it's serious?! it is very serious\nFriend: I'm so happy to be quoting this legend\nPersona: I don't actually know why it says that, I just google the actual quote and its \"Ir a\u0161 ten buvau, al\u0173 mid\u0173 g\u0117riau, per barzd\u0105 varv\u0117jo, burnoj netur\u0117jau... \" It means \"And I have also been there, I have drunk beer and mead,  so much it was dripping through my beard, had nothing in my mouth...\"\nPersona: It was always a mystery to me, I always for some reason assumed that it was because the storyteller was just a peasant in the story and didn't get to eat, but I don't know if that makes sense, since drinks were probably more expensive. Or not? This is mostly medieval times\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\nPersona: I can be your test rat\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\nFriend: and we measure the difference\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\nFriend: who said that's desired?\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: i never seen it\nPersona: I was very afraid as a kid too\nPersona: But not anymore now, I dont think anything changed, I just stopped. The best possible explanation is that I decided that if I ever die, plane crash would be the coolest way.\nPersona: jesus, thats such a terrible thing to say\nPersona: I think its just impossible. your mind will start procrastinating\nPersona: come on, fix it! I am honestly very thrilled now xd\nFriend: aw :c poor friend\nFriend: haha 'if I ever die'??? is this optional\nFriend: but plane crash the coolest? why?\nFriend: it's scary\nFriend: and possibly one of your family members would have to go and identify your burnt body if there are some remains. that's not great\nFriend: oh yeah, that's the issue. I just don't have a clear boundary between working and relaxing\nFriend: oh no, that's not the hospital I currently talk to. that was the one I did my Master's at\nFriend: the current one only does sth with cbd so more of a Facebook mum vibe rather than tripping vibe\nPersona: noooo, I did not mean that ahahaha\nPersona: you are indeed a master of dodging \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Yeah poor Jakub... But I know  he has good company\nPersona: it just feeels sad to say \"when I die..\"\nPersona: so I live a little optimism \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: leave*\nPersona: cant explain, every way I think of explaining would make me sound like a psycho \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: its like there would be atleast so much action to witness, also some chance to survive, depending on type of crash\nPersona: like sinking is a long slow death,  unspectacular when compared\nPersona: gosh lets stop this topic xd\nPersona: so yeah thats why u need the clear relax part\nPersona: are you working now?\nFriend: hahaha okay, I admit I didn't read what you were responding to\nFriend: wowo, I'm so good at this game\nFriend: what do you want me to fix then? the scale? my understanding of the scale?\nFriend: isn't that the one that was supposed to move out?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: wish I clould do the same in R\nPersona: cause the web anaconda IDE is ehhh\nFriend: R markdown looks like Jupiter notebooks but it's not so convenient\nPersona: jupyter i mean*\nFriend: Can do in r studio\nFriend: Lookup\nR markdown\nPersona: well, markdown is markdown xd\nPersona: oh\nPersona: R Markdown\nPersona: I get it, I used it a bit\nPersona: but if you dont know how to have R notebooks in Vs Code, then idk if you can help me\nPersona: Is burlesque related to bdsm?\nPersona: chat gone chineese\nPersona: Vaping promotes reflection and ideas for me\nPersona: I take breaks to vape and listen to music for 5-10 minds and I have found that:\n1) I often think of some creative ideas for ongoing or new projects\n2) I think about tasks at hand from an inactive, relaxed and distance perspective, which gives me new ideas for solutions\n3) I feel happy and confident about myself\nPersona: This is a dangerous discovery which I dont know how to act upon\nPersona: Ughh, the bikes are not as cheap. Hard to find a decent one lower than 800kr\nPersona: I am starting to think about giving repair a retry. But the more I wait, the more I spend on bus.\nPersona: ahhhh, I spend more energy thinking about it than it would cost money equivalent (perhaps)\nPersona: Idk if DYI is always a good strat\nPersona: I like DYI cause I would learn stuff, but its something quite trivial to learn, idk will it be worth later in life.\nPersona: And I better focus on my top impact agenda\nFriend: nice moral dilemma you discovered there\n\nafraid of the addictive qualities but happy with the positive effects\nFriend: Just tried the coolest can opening mechanisn\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: why reply tho?\nPersona: how does it work?\nFriend: hahaha \nthat's the most retarded thing you must have seen xD\nI replied because I wrote something but I guess it didn't go through with the picture\nFriend: I think it's a good dilemma you have there\nFriend: imo if you can control yourself kind of, it's a good thing\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: idkk, I was realy acitted indeed, idk why, I think just because I wanted to see you \ud83d\ude18\nPersona: But idk if I am feeling for techno today\nPersona: Are you taking drugs? xd\nFriend: Alrighty no worries, I was just curious\nFriend: Most probably not\nPersona: alright buddy, see ya tommorow, have a good rave\nPersona: if you in need fir a chauffeur for the night let me know\nFriend: Alrighty, see ya tomorrow!\nPersona: Tommorow 14:30 movie is Dumb Money, price 60dkk at Palace, me and Petyo (and prob his gf) are going\nPersona: Do you want to join?\nPersona: with Kaja\nPersona: So I can be a third wheel for two couples \ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Boulders are at 4pm\nFriend: So I can't xd\nPersona: we can go to boulders at 17\nPersona: but if you are busy or dont want, no worriea\nPersona: I founs this thesis by a CBS masters student about P2P loans\nPersona: I didnt read all of it, but the conclusions was that the one who already returned well for a few months are less likely to default, as they usually default in the beginning\nPersona: so I looked up on one of my platforms secondary market, where people can liquidate/resell their investments\nPersona: and I know there are some ppl who always try to do it for some premium, say 2-7%, so they get instant profit a bit without waiting\nPersona: I then browsed for loans that already returned more than 6 months on time and has less than 2-3 years left. If a loan has a rate like 25%+, even if the person is asking for 5% premium, I could buy it and then it would become a 20% loan for me, but with lower risk, as the person was already paying on time for a while\nPersona: I think I got a history of 400+ loans, I been looking forward to doing some analysis to actually find strategies to optimize this\nPersona: baught 2 like those right noe\nPersona: now*\nPersona: will check sometimes, and then see\nFriend: uuu and the research was on danish market or european? there can be some cultural differencies which can impact the risk\nFriend: or even economic state, like now we are close to recession so that can also make an impact\nPersona: I dont remember\nPersona: when I see it again I can tell you\nPersona: I need to look into how loans respond to economic downturns"

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\nPersona: WTF\nPersona: mac is cool\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster. Not even exxagerating\nFriend: Oh yeah\n\nWhen Stan showed me, it was magic\nFriend: But i think you can do that on windows too\n\nWith more setup tho\nPersona: Havent read fully but could be interesting\nPersona: If you want to improve decision making speed or suffer from decision paralysis (which I do)\nFriend: looks like a good read\nFriend: I'll check it out\nFriend: I swear my \"almost\" accidents with the bike are mostly women or colored foreigners\nFriend: once an oldie\nFriend: today a woman decided the bike lane means extra points x___x\nFriend: she got scared when I decided to cross\nPersona: Xddd\nPersona: what do you mean? She was with car?\nPersona: Its a consensus that women are worse drivers. But also its pretty known that women get into accidents lets afaik\nPersona: less*\nPersona: If you take pen testing, women have a offensive advantage\nFriend: what\nPersona: xddd idk why this 'what' soundes funny\nPersona: i will explain later\nFriend: Aaah!\nFriend: Like the lady bond villains\nFriend: I got nais balls\nFriend: Really big pack\nPersona: XDDDDDDD\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: cant explain, every way I think of explaining would make me sound like a psycho \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: its like there would be atleast so much action to witness, also some chance to survive, depending on type of crash\nPersona: like sinking is a long slow death,  unspectacular when compared\nPersona: gosh lets stop this topic xd\nPersona: so yeah thats why u need the clear relax part\nPersona: are you working now?\nFriend: hahaha okay, I admit I didn't read what you were responding to\nFriend: wowo, I'm so good at this game\nFriend: what do you want me to fix then? the scale? my understanding of the scale?\nFriend: isn't that the one that was supposed to move out?\nFriend: what?! this is like the opposite of psycho death\nFriend: I have a lot questions, but I'm going to be nice and respect your wish\nFriend: semi. I'm at the library learning Matlab\nPersona: omgg xddddd im laughing\nPersona: i actually dont know what, you said the word fix first \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: nah, that was patryk\nPersona: really? is it one of my those misunderstandings of disordee meanings?\nPersona: although I was trying to say it in the nicest way\nPersona: by action to witness, I imagined like cabin pressure loss, hull breaking in two mid air, explosions, flying out of the plane\nPersona: oh well, too late\nPersona: I have expanded more unfortunatelly\nPersona: whaaaat? fo real? I am in my cozy bed, listening to macmiller\nPersona: why matlab tho?\nFriend: eh mistakes were made. okay, change of the strategy. forget the scale. how does your schedule look like in general\nFriend: what. how many Polish friends do you have haha. you have more Polish friends than I do\nFriend: oh no, I was referring to psycho in a common vernacular sense here. I wasn't even considering the psychiatric sense\nFriend: I wonder whether you'd even feel anything if you fell out. I remember the story of that lady who got sucked out of the window and I think she died almost immediately\nPersona: a very generalized version look like this\nFriend: I'm still basically unfurnished so not home much these days\nFriend: I need it for my potential job and in general it's useful in neuro\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\nPersona: And things get interesting then\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\nPersona: but hmm\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\nFriend: to help you get there?\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\nPersona: Need to fix that\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\nFriend: exactly :D\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\nFriend: less like*\nPersona: which tips?\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just did a month ago. Few people got salary increases, yet I asked for a really fat raise, as a part-timer, and they had to pay me, I made it clear I was not fooling around\nFriend: 1st lol. I never dared to try\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I copied from internet mostly, so I don't sound too frustrated\nPersona: this is perfect\nFriend: javascript\nPersona: i think I know this\nFriend: Am I retarded\nPersona: what? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: xd\nPersona: funny\nPersona: or are you asking if you are r\u0119tarded?\nPersona: Lol I think how I see myself in the mirror is worse than I actually am\nFriend: I ask\nPersona: no not at all \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: I honestly think that you may think of yourself much less than atleast what looks you have\nFriend: Cause when you are retarded maybe you don't know\nPersona: oh\nPersona: I thought its about the looks\nFriend: That im curious too but its just too lucky i got\nPersona: oh\nFriend: So i thought maybe im not lucky and its for a reason\nPersona: how does it have to do with being retarded?\nPersona: lol\nPersona: thats overthinking at its finest\nFriend: Cause maybe i am and colleagues pitty me and give me a win for the competition\nFriend: I did the math. Its more likely\nPersona: this is a reddit post. \n\nI though I am retarded because I guessed a 1/400 random number\nPersona: oh\nPersona: in that way\nPersona: but why out of pity?\nFriend: Wanna bike the holiday?\nIm taking the dino for a ride maybe\nFriend: Cause im retarded\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: so you would have to resort to melee combat, animal etc to fight for you I guess. Or build turrets\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute.

Hard to find a decent one lower than 800kr\nPersona: I am starting to think about giving repair a retry. But the more I wait, the more I spend on bus.\nPersona: ahhhh, I spend more energy thinking about it than it would cost money equivalent (perhaps)\nPersona: Idk if DYI is always a good strat\nPersona: I like DYI cause I would learn stuff, but its something quite trivial to learn, idk will it be worth later in life.\nPersona: And I better focus on my top impact agenda\nFriend: nice moral dilemma you discovered there\n\nafraid of the addictive qualities but happy with the positive effects\nFriend: Just tried the coolest can opening mechanisn\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: why reply tho?\nPersona: how does it work?\nFriend: hahaha \nthat's the most retarded thing you must have seen xD\nI replied because I wrote something but I guess it didn't go through with the picture\nFriend: I think it's a good dilemma you have there\nFriend: imo if you can control yourself kind of, it's a good thing\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\nPersona: and planet types\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\nPersona: so thats the lore\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think I judge courses too much by the crowd\nPersona: like ITU really turned me off for some reason, althought I talked to very few.

Text below:\nConversations between persona and friends\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Gonna be using it often\nFriend: How many cards a day do you usually do? What\u2019s your limit?\nPersona: I havent' been stuying much, except for the past week\nPersona: but\nFriend: Your pronunciation is funny, but it makes sense most of the time\nFriend: Some letters are similar to polish so I\u2019d also write it this way\nFriend: But tbh I just spent some time practicing the danish sounds so it\u2019s easier to read without \u201ctranslating\u201d them\nPersona: if you are only relying on my written pronunciations, I recomend not xdd\nPersona: they are not bad, but idk if they are the same in poland for sure\nFriend: Especially enjoyed practicing soft d\nPersona: :DDDDDDDDD\nFriend: XDDD\nPersona: fuck this soft d\nPersona: l\ud83e\udd2e\nPersona: *Literally pronouncing soft d*\nFriend: One of my favs to pronounce is neutral\nFriend: Probounced as neu\u010dRRRa\ud83e\udd2e\nPersona: xddd\nPersona: omg I don't even know what I meant\nFriend: Dont worry, i just came up with it\nFriend: Youre fine\nPersona: ohhh\nFriend: Your anki are good\nPersona: wow\nPersona: I believed\nPersona: you got me\nFriend: But too easy for now \ud83e\udd20\nFriend: Sorry\nPersona: At one point I learnt that I made cards in a stupid way with no examples\nPersona: then i changed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It means what for\nFriend: Funny one\nPersona: 99% should be correct. Some sentences were made by GPT4 \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: the pronounciations are quite personalized to how I read letters in Lithuanian, so idk if that will help for you \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: almost a tragic miscommunication\nFriend: first I have to figure out how to use it on mac\nPersona: yeaaaah, it can be a bit complex at first\nPersona: ask me questions if you want I am a veteran xd\nFriend: yeah, now I remember why I didn\u2019t use it\nPersona: I have 19000 cards (~10 000 are the spanish ones that I downlaoded, but only went through like 200)\nFriend: i like the comfort of good uxui\nPersona: yeah the UI is semi-modern. It used to be way worse\nFriend: Wasn\u2019t that difficult at the end, synced everything\nFriend: I was actually going to study danish now so gonna try anki\nPersona: let me know how my cards fare\nFriend: Ok, I see how it\u2019s tailored\nFriend: Lad os tale forretning\nPersona: cxddddd\nPersona: oh yeha\nPersona: important phrase to know\nFriend: Gonna be using it often\nFriend: How many cards a day do you usually do? What\u2019s your limit?\nPersona: I havent' been stuying much, except for the past week\nPersona: but\nFriend: Your pronunciation is funny, but it makes sense most of the time\nFriend: Some letters are similar to polish so I\u2019d also write it this way\nFriend: But tbh I just spent some time practicing the danish sounds so it\u2019s easier to read without \u201ctranslating\u201d them\nPersona: if you are only relying on my written pronunciations, I recomend not xdd\nPersona: they are not bad, but idk if they are the same in poland for sure\nFriend: Especially enjoyed practicing soft d\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah, precisely\nPersona: or just\nPersona: you are very unique to talk to\nPersona: ah. But also I can handle asshole. As you would assume, I have to deal with 100 of them at school everyday anyways.\nPersona: where do you work?\nPersona: oh you would not imagine\nPersona: I am going to ITU tommorow at 16 with my classmate for open days\nPersona: Plan is to scout masters programs, but most importantly, tame some nerds, so they can bring us to the scroll bar - the nerd hive.\nPersona: Because the Scroll bar instagram staff got passive aggresssive in terms of answering to my requests to come on some friday. I asked a couple of times and instead of replying they posted this\nPersona: I was thinking of a few options to comment\na) I don't have any friends from ITU. can I register myself?\nb) I dare myself to ask a random student in the campus to sign me up. Can I get a free beer then?\nc)  deadlock exception, since my ITU friend count is 0 and can't instantiate any without connecting to scroll bar ITU friend factory. Pls patch, thx.\nf) can somebody pls sign me up? I will buy you 10 beers (the number may or may not be expressed in binary, I am not sure yet)\n\nbut I will not comment anything, may our minds be entertained by the fictitious conversations each of the options would have created\nPersona: does this illustrate you thinking accuratelly?\nPersona: oh fuck. I read this again. This sounded wrong\nPersona: well idk if wrong. not straight at least\nFriend: thank you\nFriend: oh that was about my weekend barista job\nFriend: um aren't you supposed to make friends there? I'm thinking that perhaps trying not to piss people off would be quite helpful in that endeavour\nFriend: exactly. tris is real life footage from my thinking process\nFriend: lol. but 100s of them? no wonder you're so busy\nPersona: I meant the location\nPersona: yeah, so that why I didnt fire any of these comments\nFriend: it's called perron\nPersona: hm. its not working. Try thinking in different pose\nFriend: will try\nPersona: okay, try that one, will you?\nPersona: I bet you will come up with th best ideas\nPersona: btw, great success today - made friends with two ITU people that will sign me up for Scroll bar\nPersona: I also had a great laugh from this italian data science professor, he kept using the adjective Ultra. Sometimes for him things very even ultra ultra something. Me and my friend my a bet whether he will say \"giga\" and then we also made a bet that if he said ultra ultra ultra (3 time), I would stand up and correct him, that in this case he should say giga.\nPersona: But none of that happen. We concluded that his best one was \"ultra stellar\"\nPersona: made*\nPersona: but I concluded I will probably not apply to ITU\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I read texts, and then when I take notes, I apply levels of formating to each word regarding their added value to the text. So from this\nPersona: I get to this\nPersona: I want a GPT model, to do this selection for me, but its not that easy\nPersona: I asked it to mark important parts but I think it sucks\nPersona: But when I asked it to \"Can you rewrite this paragraph without changing words, but by just removing all of the words that are less significant to the main point?\" it was kinda not bad, but it ended up adding a few new words and not much of the text was reduced.\nPersona: This is not bad tho\nPersona: this is actually good\nPersona: Imagine then having a slider, which allow you to 'control the contrast of the text'\nPersona: Where as higher the contrast the more less significant words get dimmed and the more significant words get emphasized\nPersona: skimming just became easier\nPersona: I had to try it\nPersona: But idk, not happy with results. Tried tuning it a bit, changing prompts, but what I got to does not feel like what I would do\nPersona: Although the last one is not that bad\nPersona: Give me some text tommorow that you had to read or smth, could be multiple pages and pdf also good, I will run it through so highlight/hide the text.\nPersona: Dude makes fun tech stories\nFriend: Yooo\nYou wrote a lot of ai stuff\nHaven't had time to see all\nPersona: fuck it\nPersona: if you have time :Dd\nPersona: then read it, otherwise, can be skipped\nFriend: Its interesting qhat you found\nCause i wanna try using lang chain to make ai docs\nFriend: Lol nice\nFriend: Always slipping\n\nIts like ice skating shoes but for asphalt\nPersona: Xddd\nPersona: The artsyles prompt ideas are pretty cool though. And combining them is nice\nPersona: Good for making steam, forum avatars\nPersona: What do you use for notetaking?\nFriend: Notion is the shit imo\nFriend: Used it during internship\nFriend: Have a journal there\nFriend: And anything that has a time i try to immediately put in the calendar so i can keep track of life\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I just did a month ago. Few people got salary increases, yet I asked for a really fat raise, as a part-timer, and they had to pay me, I made it clear I was not fooling around\nFriend: 1st lol. I never dared to try\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: whats your view and whats unhealthy about it?\nFriend: Found it ty\nFriend: I want skills but feel like i shouldn't go for it\nBecause i was not good at bigger picture. Relations etc. Need to go for that \nMaybe it's not unhealthy but it goes against what i want and am comfortable with. Want to stay in my bubble\nPersona: What do you mean by skills? coding and hands-on stuff?\nPersona: And by relations, big picture you mean management, right?\nFriend: Yeah. Hard skills \n\nAlso i lack management knowledge but it requires a lot more soft skills too\nFriend: I can go to Silvan today and pick up what you chose if you like?\nAnd get.for myself\nFriend: Or would you prefer friday and go together\nPersona: It would be hard to transport stuff in bike \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Nah\nBackpacks\nCan totally do it\nPersona: bruh, inflatable matress? - no\nPersona: 1 may fit. 2 - impossible\nPersona: Lets go on friday\nFriend: Is this a challenge\nFriend: I carried your table on bkke\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: Laura has sleep stuff\nFriend: I wrote Sam and Arijan\nPersona: You work today?\nPersona: no, not a challenge \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Ye\nPersona: when do you finish?\nFriend: I planned off around noon\nFriend: Go give doctor pee\nFriend: Meet Laura\nShe offered if i wanna shop at her Silvan\nPersona: You can take my car then if you want to go today\nPersona: I will have it at CBS until evening probably\nPersona: so you can take it anytime\nFriend: I don't want to car when i think i can bike it\n\nAlso need to plan because i guess today wiuld be hard\nFriend: But youre ok then if i pick up for  bith of us?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: cant explain, every way I think of explaining would make me sound like a psycho \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: its like there would be atleast so much action to witness, also some chance to survive, depending on type of crash\nPersona: like sinking is a long slow death,  unspectacular when compared\nPersona: gosh lets stop this topic xd\nPersona: so yeah thats why u need the clear relax part\nPersona: are you working now?\nFriend: hahaha okay, I admit I didn't read what you were responding to\nFriend: wowo, I'm so good at this game\nFriend: what do you want me to fix then? the scale? my understanding of the scale?\nFriend: isn't that the one that was supposed to move out?\nFriend: what?! this is like the opposite of psycho death\nFriend: I have a lot questions, but I'm going to be nice and respect your wish\nFriend: semi. I'm at the library learning Matlab\nPersona: omgg xddddd im laughing\nPersona: i actually dont know what, you said the word fix first \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: nah, that was patryk\nPersona: really? is it one of my those misunderstandings of disordee meanings?\nPersona: although I was trying to say it in the nicest way\nPersona: by action to witness, I imagined like cabin pressure loss, hull breaking in two mid air, explosions, flying out of the plane\nPersona: oh well, too late\nPersona: I have expanded more unfortunatelly\nPersona: whaaaat? fo real? I am in my cozy bed, listening to macmiller\nPersona: why matlab tho?\nFriend: eh mistakes were made. okay, change of the strategy. forget the scale. how does your schedule look like in general\nFriend: what. how many Polish friends do you have haha. you have more Polish friends than I do\nFriend: oh no, I was referring to psycho in a common vernacular sense here. I wasn't even considering the psychiatric sense\nFriend: I wonder whether you'd even feel anything if you fell out. I remember the story of that lady who got sucked out of the window and I think she died almost immediately\nPersona: a very generalized version look like this\nFriend: I'm still basically unfurnished so not home much these days\nFriend: I need it for my potential job and in general it's useful in neuro\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)"

Somebody thought somebody did the math\nPersona: but nobody did the math\nFriend: exactly\nPersona: but so many people baught that the buying changed the math itself, so now the math is suddently good anyways\nPersona: time to write that personal statement.

Hard to find a decent one lower than 800kr\nPersona: I am starting to think about giving repair a retry. But the more I wait, the more I spend on bus.\nPersona: ahhhh, I spend more energy thinking about it than it would cost money equivalent (perhaps)\nPersona: Idk if DYI is always a good strat\nPersona: I like DYI cause I would learn stuff, but its something quite trivial to learn, idk will it be worth later in life.\nPersona: And I better focus on my top impact agenda\nFriend: nice moral dilemma you discovered there\n\nafraid of the addictive qualities but happy with the positive effects\nFriend: Just tried the coolest can opening mechanisn\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: why reply tho?\nPersona: how does it work?\nFriend: hahaha \nthat's the most retarded thing you must have seen xD\nI replied because I wrote something but I guess it didn't go through with the picture\nFriend: I think it's a good dilemma you have there\nFriend: imo if you can control yourself kind of, it's a good thing\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: The girls got 12s\nThey did real good\nZoe and Mada\nFriend: Ah like the dtu engineering one you sent me\n\nGood to figure out\nFriend: I think for cbs maybe the courses extra i took and grades played a role\n\nCause Elena applied but didnt get in\nFriend: And rn while u study you still have a chance to get extra course and pts in other uni maybe\nIf you need the pts or theyd like that\nFriend: Kinda\nBut will try to have a break like an adult\nActually get work done and not slack\n\nLooking at apartments for buying\n\nLearning rules and whatnot\n\nWill apply for rentals too\nFriend: I was at an apartment viewing with Laura today and will go next week to a mini house\nPersona: yeah for sure!\nPersona: lets book sauna\nPersona: somehow\nPersona: I had issues with that\nPersona: Edward, Patryk I know weren't that lucky\nPersona: DTU not gonna work.

He is danish too\nWill write him\nFriend: \"\nFeeling extreme cold from time to time (like we probably would in a natural habitat) significantly reduces inflammatory processes in the body. Therefore some diseases are treated this way already - like rheumatic inflammations of the joints - with very good results.\n\nAlso since cancer often starts with untreated inflammatory processes, exposing yourself to extreme cold from time to time could be a very good way to reduce your personal cancer risk.\n\nPlus: studies induce that it works with extreme heat as well.\"\nFriend: wonder what cancer rates of danes are\n\nsince they do cold and sauna\nFriend: The highest cancer rate for men and women combined was in Denmark at 334.9 people per 100,000.\n\nnvm xD\nFriend: can also be a function of testing.. not gonna make conclusions off of that\nPersona: do you like it?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: idkk, I was realy acitted indeed, idk why, I think just because I wanted to see you \ud83d\ude18\nPersona: But idk if I am feeling for techno today\nPersona: Are you taking drugs? xd\nFriend: Alrighty no worries, I was just curious\nFriend: Most probably not\nPersona: alright buddy, see ya tommorow, have a good rave\nPersona: if you in need fir a chauffeur for the night let me know\nFriend: Alrighty, see ya tomorrow!\nPersona: Tommorow 14:30 movie is Dumb Money, price 60dkk at Palace, me and Petyo (and prob his gf) are going\nPersona: Do you want to join?\nPersona: with Kaja\nPersona: So I can be a third wheel for two couples \ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Boulders are at 4pm\nFriend: So I can't xd\nPersona: we can go to boulders at 17\nPersona: but if you are busy or dont want, no worriea\nPersona: I founs this thesis by a CBS masters student about P2P loans\nPersona: I didnt read all of it, but the conclusions was that the one who already returned well for a few months are less likely to default, as they usually default in the beginning\nPersona: so I looked up on one of my platforms secondary market, where people can liquidate/resell their investments\nPersona: and I know there are some ppl who always try to do it for some premium, say 2-7%, so they get instant profit a bit without waiting\nPersona: I then browsed for loans that already returned more than 6 months on time and has less than 2-3 years left. If a loan has a rate like 25%+, even if the person is asking for 5% premium, I could buy it and then it would become a 20% loan for me, but with lower risk, as the person was already paying on time for a while\nPersona: I think I got a history of 400+ loans, I been looking forward to doing some analysis to actually find strategies to optimize this\nPersona: baught 2 like those right noe\nPersona: now*\nPersona: will check sometimes, and then see\nFriend: uuu and the research was on danish market or european? there can be some cultural differencies which can impact the risk\nFriend: or even economic state, like now we are close to recession so that can also make an impact\nPersona: I dont remember\nPersona: when I see it again I can tell you\nPersona: I need to look into how loans respond to economic downturns\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: omg I was just thinking about it as you texted\nPersona: I think people at KU are very kind\nPersona: survivability wise, I talked to a machine learning engineer and I would say I barely survived, it was loud, I was tipsy and he got pretty technical. I have some semi-deep machine learning understanding so I survived the conversation.\nPersona: I think he was one of the semi-social types\nPersona: I was actually just thinking of how to meet more people from DTU and ITU. Their bars are great options. Although in bars, only semi-social breed spawns (the ones we are trying to eradicate), if I want to find anti-social, I need new ways\nPersona: I know uni classes are technically public in some way so I can just drop in to a class and listen in, talk to some people during the break or after.\nPersona: KU people\nFriend: I think that's just because compared to CBS douchebags everyone is kind \ud83e\udd10\nFriend: oh no, did you get recruited for something? it was supposed to be the other way around!\nFriend: what do you need the antisocials for?\nFriend: I think that would weird them out\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e excuse you, that's dtu\nPersona: it might actually be true. and its unbelievable how being at CBS can make myself a bit of a douchebag as well\nPersona: I just tried myself at making an impression that I know more technical things that the average cbs douchebag\nPersona: I think I did not bad, he really made sure I got his LinkedIn at the end, but ohhh, my brain started melting at one point.\nPersona: I think they are extra intelligent\nPersona: why would you, a KU alumni, give this superiority label to DTU? :O\nFriend: do you think it has changed you?\nFriend: hope at least you managed to sell him some illegal straws in return\nFriend: isnt that interesting how these two things often go hand in hand?\nFriend: because I'm kind (apparently)\nPersona: I think I have changed, but I am not sure of the definition of a doucheabag, might be the same situation with autistic\nPersona: Thus I will run a test\nPersona: I found this douchebag simulator game\nPersona: will see if I can relate and get back to you\nPersona: well, thats exactly my purpose in life\nPersona: its crazy accurate, this is exactly how my reflections each day look\nPersona: this is straight outta CBS strategy management book\nPersona: my first day as a douchebag was incredible. I went to work at a construction site. made 300$ in 8 hours, then went to gym for 3 hours, then went home, eat a 40$ protein pack, got my energy back up, then went clubbing the whole night spending 100$. After this day my douchebag level increased by 1\nPersona: I think I am a natural talent\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\nPersona: haha\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what methods did you discover?\nPersona: share them, I am interested for my own utility \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: spreadsheets?\nPersona: Hunger is so annoying like, idk what to ea\nPersona: eat*\nPersona: I am so bored of cooking and eating\nPersona: I wish to have like automatic eating\nFriend: Almost no spreadsheets. Just abusing google calendar and reporting daily to Kinga (it goes both ways). Perfect way to keep ourselves accountable and maintain long distance friendship \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: how did you manage to do assigments in a week after they are assigned? I would have big will power problems\nPersona: I've been lately experimenting a lot with calender too, come up with this one method, working good so far, but not mature to share yet\nPersona: Once a few weeks? :oooo\nPersona: Hm\nPersona: I do mass cooking every week, but I dont freeze stuff\nPersona: Shopping wise, hm perhaps I could try online\nPersona: maybe I should also try freezing\nPersona: Overall I feel like there is a lot in common that we do regarding this whole productivity theory\nFriend: I see them as something to \u201eget rid of\u201d xd Assignments are related to what we had on the lectures/classes. Doing the them helps me understand the most important concepts and I don\u2019t have to study that much later on.\nFriend: As I said, my \u201ctechniques\u201d are no rocket science but it took me some time to build and adapt this mindset\nFriend: Yeah, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m only eating frozen meals but the thing is that I don\u2019t have to cook if I don\u2019t want to. But that\u2019s why I also mentioned having ingredients for all of the basic and quick meals.\nFor me it\u2019s mainly oatmeal, pasta and miso soup. I can make these in around 15min so I don\u2019t consider it as \u201ccooking\u201d\nFriend: Oh and also, with my lifestyle it\u2019s very inconvenient to do it differently. As I have a few projects going on, there\u2019s more important and fun stuff to worry about than throwing all nighters to do some assignments ;) that\u2019s the engine for my will power\nPersona: a nice danish song\nPersona: with english part\nPersona: ugh, yeah, but they are usuallly at low urgency after they get assigned\nPersona: I stopped eating oatmeal rn. I got too bored finally\nFriend: I\u2019m preparing for a hybrid way of living that I wish to have. Soo being able to work and study anywhere anytime? Check. Having (almost) no fresh produce in the fridge? Check. Minimising the amount of stuff that I own? Check.\n\nHaving all that brings me lots of convenience and peace\nPersona: true, the goal of this semester for now is to not have any allnighters\nPersona: its the bane of my will to live\nFriend: So be the one who creates that urgency. Treat yourself with doing more important things after you get rid of those\nPersona: that is a nice setup\nFriend: I have classes only on some of the weekends so usually I start working on notes and assignments in the evenings during the weekend or on the first few days after that(for bigger assignments). Is it tiring? Yes. But does it pay off? Very much\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: it's called perron\nPersona: hm. its not working. Try thinking in different pose\nFriend: will try\nPersona: okay, try that one, will you?\nPersona: I bet you will come up with th best ideas\nPersona: btw, great success today - made friends with two ITU people that will sign me up for Scroll bar\nPersona: I also had a great laugh from this italian data science professor, he kept using the adjective Ultra. Sometimes for him things very even ultra ultra something. Me and my friend my a bet whether he will say \"giga\" and then we also made a bet that if he said ultra ultra ultra (3 time), I would stand up and correct him, that in this case he should say giga.\nPersona: But none of that happen. We concluded that his best one was \"ultra stellar\"\nPersona: made*\nPersona: but I concluded I will probably not apply to ITU\nFriend: why\nPersona: I think one of the programmes at DTU will be better\nFriend: shit, sorry. I was a bit drunk yesterday, and apparently overconfident that I can multi-task during a pee break\nFriend: tbh that why took all the power of my remaining 1.5 brain cells and a headstand\nFriend: but what's the vibe of people there in general? I don't hear anything about that school ever, except that it exists\nFriend: hahah was he so hyped up about itu or about data science?\nFriend: I'm def stealing this one\nFriend: you know, I never really go open days bc I feel like it doesn't really represent the place accurately, i.e. everything seems 1000x better than in reality\nFriend: but I've always wondered whether I'm missing out or not\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: if I can do it (done it in the past successfully), then you should definetely be able to\nPersona: just pee longer\nPersona: Xdddd\nPersona: how much ethanol intoxitacion did you have? \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: although if you did a headstand... well, a short accidental headstand could very well be a symptom of high ethanol intoxication, so its possible I guess\nPersona: yeah, its quite rare to meet the ITU species. Vybe is nerdier, my best discovery was that they host occassional LAN parties (everybody brings they gaming rigs to school and play League, csgo, etc tournaments all night while drinking energy drinks)\nPersona: That I would like to participate abd I got conctacts\nPersona: but I think to find out the real vibe, an experiential visit to the scroll bar must be done. And we already made some connections there that will add us to the guest list this friday. So for that you will have to come with me and find out \ud83e\udd20\nPersona: I think the combination, he kept emphasizing (ultraemphasizing) that its so ultra ultra cool that the lecturers who teach each data science course are also active reaearchers in these topics\nPersona: I kinda took it for granted at CBS, but he was positioning it as a real USP (Unique selling point)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I then browsed for loans that already returned more than 6 months on time and has less than 2-3 years left. If a loan has a rate like 25%+, even if the person is asking for 5% premium, I could buy it and then it would become a 20% loan for me, but with lower risk, as the person was already paying on time for a while\nPersona: I think I got a history of 400+ loans, I been looking forward to doing some analysis to actually find strategies to optimize this\nPersona: baught 2 like those right noe\nPersona: now*\nPersona: will check sometimes, and then see\nFriend: uuu and the research was on danish market or european? there can be some cultural differencies which can impact the risk\nFriend: or even economic state, like now we are close to recession so that can also make an impact\nPersona: I dont remember\nPersona: when I see it again I can tell you\nPersona: I need to look into how loans respond to economic downturns\nPersona: during corona it was chill\nPersona: are you conspirint about smth big it a normal cycle recession?\nPersona: europe just has a recession\nPersona: Why do you think a recession is coming?\nPersona: maybe because of inflation\nFriend: because we increasing our intrest rates and that almost always outcomes in recession\nFriend: as investment decreases\nFriend: gdp decreases too\nFriend: so that's also a risk for you as the loans you give also get a 5% central bank intrest rate\nFriend: and if people/companies are arleady in debt then this 5% can make a huge differences in their business stability and development\nFriend: I don't travel with my weed\nFriend: Xddd\nPersona: thats for krem\nPersona: or lubricant, safety cum, etc\nFriend: Mehhh\nFriend: Don't travel with that either\nPersona: L'auberge espagnole\nFriend: Why you think so\nPersona: It captures multicultural experience very well\nFriend: Gonna check it out\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\nPersona: ok wait, I'll review them\nPersona: why not idea 3?\nPersona: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\nFriend: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\nFriend: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\nPersona: ok I am checking them rn\nPersona: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\nPersona: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\nPersona: I had one chance and I took it\nFriend: Don't stress it\nPersona: i think i agree with you\nPersona: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\nPersona: Except for Toke and Marion I think\nPersona: I wrote in green\nPersona: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\nFriend: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\nPersona: with ideas, like you wrote?\nPersona: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\nFriend: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\nFriend: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\nFriend: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nFriend: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nPersona: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nPersona: I don't think its silly to assume*\nPersona: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nPersona: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nPersona: So will skip him\nFriend: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I may have played to many war games and seen to many war movies haha\nPersona: even right now I am watching oppenheimer xd\nPersona: I think right away. I have a thesis topic to confirm. Going to Sweden on a work trip for a short time soon though\nPersona: and you? Did you get that research position?\nFriend: not at all. I'm way too jumpy for that\nFriend: on a small screen? that should be illegal\nFriend: fun! and what's your topic?\nFriend: no clue. they told me to write to them again mid Jan\nPersona: yeeeeah I know, but I think big screens no longer show it\nPersona: I don't know yet, we have a month to confirm, but me and classmate were discussing a lot about it, we know the topics that we both relate to\nPersona: give me a sec\nPersona: some ideas\nPersona: topics rather\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\nFriend: but happy for you!\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: lol\nPersona: Yeah I guess its  unit-of-time-invested/unit-of-relationship-utility would give something similar to economic scale and diseconomies of scale graph.\nFriend: i kind of want to test that\nFriend: but some of the questions I feel hard asking them in person if around other people\nFriend: these feel more like 1:1\nFriend: questions\nPersona: yeah, some. Some can be good. Say you are discussing football with someone and they are talking about their achievements, you can go like \"What inspired you to go so far on football?\"\nFriend: I'll be reviewing the questions list when I go out socially and see if I can get something going\nPersona: I should try that aswell, like pulling out this list lol\nPersona: thats super weird\nPersona: imagine somoone noticed\nFriend: \ud83d\ude04\nPersona: But, after a few times I guess I memorize\nPersona: Do you know Loqseq?\nPersona: Its for note-taking\nPersona: today I realized its deep af\nPersona: You can even build custom queries to pull notes. But the query language is brainfuck-like\nFriend: looks decent \nHavent seen before\nPersona: its time\nPersona: basically\nPersona: New UI\nPersona: and more emojis\nFriend: I saw \"Lofton\" and I thought is the dude black?\n\nlooked up name origin tho. Turns out it's an English name\nFriend: was super interesting to listen. Cool way to finance stuff\nFriend: And the way they did it makes total sense with getting government involved\n\nI talked with colleagues wednesday at end of work day\n\nthey're danes\n\nand even they suffer with getting a home and a lot get in the outskirts\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\nPersona: glad in was interesting. I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\nPersona: you not sleep?"

Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nFriend: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nPersona: no worries maan\nPersona: damn early bird, 06:16\nFriend: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nPersona: ohh ur going today\nPersona: this song is so good\nFriend: Smart way of learning Danish!\nFriend: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nFriend: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nPersona: Hey, looked at the email now\nPersona: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nPersona: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nPersona: He looks pretty old\nPersona: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nPersona: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nPersona: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nPersona: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nPersona: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nPersona: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nPersona: Also\nPersona: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nPersona: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nPersona: This could be huge\nPersona: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nPersona: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: wish I clould do the same in R\nPersona: cause the web anaconda IDE is ehhh\nFriend: R markdown looks like Jupiter notebooks but it's not so convenient\nPersona: jupyter i mean*\nFriend: Can do in r studio\nFriend: Lookup\nR markdown\nPersona: well, markdown is markdown xd\nPersona: oh\nPersona: R Markdown\nPersona: I get it, I used it a bit\nPersona: but if you dont know how to have R notebooks in Vs Code, then idk if you can help me\nPersona: Is burlesque related to bdsm?\nPersona: chat gone chineese\nPersona: Vaping promotes reflection and ideas for me\nPersona: I take breaks to vape and listen to music for 5-10 minds and I have found that:\n1) I often think of some creative ideas for ongoing or new projects\n2) I think about tasks at hand from an inactive, relaxed and distance perspective, which gives me new ideas for solutions\n3) I feel happy and confident about myself\nPersona: This is a dangerous discovery which I dont know how to act upon\nPersona: Ughh, the bikes are not as cheap. Hard to find a decent one lower than 800kr\nPersona: I am starting to think about giving repair a retry. But the more I wait, the more I spend on bus.\nPersona: ahhhh, I spend more energy thinking about it than it would cost money equivalent (perhaps)\nPersona: Idk if DYI is always a good strat\nPersona: I like DYI cause I would learn stuff, but its something quite trivial to learn, idk will it be worth later in life.\nPersona: And I better focus on my top impact agenda\nFriend: nice moral dilemma you discovered there\n\nafraid of the addictive qualities but happy with the positive effects\nFriend: Just tried the coolest can opening mechanisn\nPersona: xdddd\nPersona: why reply tho?\nPersona: how does it work?\nFriend: hahaha \nthat's the most retarded thing you must have seen xD\nI replied because I wrote something but I guess it didn't go through with the picture\nFriend: I think it's a good dilemma you have there\nFriend: imo if you can control yourself kind of, it's a good thing\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yes\nPersona: dont forget cbs card, vic\nFriend: it\u2019s gone i thought it was in my wallet\nFriend: but rheyre fine with my passport\nFriend: Airi\nFriend: i kind of want to study the digital management master but theres 2 coding classes that seem harder than what my brain can comprehend\nFriend: can i buy you hahaha as my tutor if i do that\nPersona: You are talking about the digital business right?\nPersona: Or information systems?\nFriend: no yeah digital business\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\nFriend: really? why?\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe it myself too xd\nPersona: But I believe myself, because I know I will put extra effort xf\nPersona: For the application for this program one can also submit a video\nPersona: I am thinking of doing that instead of a motivational letter\nFriend: do that!\nFriend: think it will increase your chances from 98% to 99% and this one percent may matter <3\nPersona: aahahaahah\nPersona: 98% to 99% increase, would decrease the chance of failure from 2% to 1%. Thats a 50% decrease in the chance of failure\nFriend: can you just take a look on changes I made? the green one (your file).\nPersona: Can I do it a bit later?\nPersona: 10mln DKK evaluation\nPersona: I been with this guy in Poland togetheer\nPersona: I drunk bimber with this dude\nPersona: not competent because you cant code it yourself?\nFriend: among others\nPersona: but what are the other incompetencies?\nFriend: entrepeneurial knowledge/skills overall\nPersona: for entrepreneurial knowledge, I would say just do it, learn it along the way\nPersona: for the skills, apart from building the full stack, I dont see a skill issue in you\nFriend: will give it a thought when I'm done with applying for master programmes\nPersona: so many people in bachelor programs found businesses\nPersona: what else r u applyinf for.\nPersona: ?*\nFriend: im thinking about DM and Innovation in Healthcare\nFriend: ITU has good options but they require Danish\nPersona: not all of them\nPersona: healthcare? really?\nFriend: It seems to me to be more specialized and that equals higher salary and higher chances of finding a good job. I was at event organized by this program and consulting company and it seemed like there is plenty of challanges within the processes that could be nice to work with, price managment, marketing and overall business side of healthcare. Overall healthcare become more informatized so I could link the tech with business. Also, implants market becomes bigger and it seems like it's gonna be a cash cow for sure\nFriend: Can you take a look on the changes I made in the personal statement in green color?\nPersona: The changes look good. I think one detailed example paints a better and more convincing story than three briefly listed experiences.\nI think the erasmus+ and kea parts now make a really good impression for this kind of course.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nFriend: Probably a good Idea\nFriend: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nPersona: He is platforms dude\nFriend: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nPersona: from him?\nPersona: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nPersona: but not on the other 2 I gues\nFriend: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nPersona: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nPersona: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nPersona: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nPersona: cause if not we should get looking\nPersona: perhaps\nPersona: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nPersona: we showed we are serious and won him\nFriend: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nFriend: true\nPersona: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nPersona: Dude\nPersona: I just found the term for idea one I think\nPersona: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nFriend: sounds accurate\nPersona: wait a sec\nPersona: I'll show you some gold\nPersona: read the yellow parts'ishg\nPersona: literally 100% what we were talking about\nFriend: U did it again!\nFriend: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\nPersona: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: uh\nFriend: what\u2019s the idea\nFriend: it\u2019s so smart making startup in equine sports bc people are rich and want to spent all their coins in their horses\nPersona: is your app idea for rich people with horses also?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: yes\nFriend: also the poor ones\nFriend: but it might cater more to ambitious riders\nFriend: which means their probably have money\nPersona: okay next time lets talk about your billion dollar idea\nFriend: yeahhh\nPersona: We have this business idea for bite-sized finance goals.

I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: nice\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\nPersona: yo wtf\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\nPersona: click the three dots\nPersona: and there is install app button\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: This is a feature not a bug\nYoubsee how much you slept over\nPersona: xddd\nPersona: its for summit keynote launch\nPersona: at my work there is this girl\nPersona: Ugne\nPersona: also a Lithuanian\nPersona: she worked as a customer service/specialist for 1-2 years and then pushed really she said to be put on the developer team\nPersona: Now she is doing front-end with react for the app\nPersona: The thing is, she is quite pretty even to my standards\nPersona: of course, not paradox breaking pretty, but getting closer\nPersona: but also she is front end.
