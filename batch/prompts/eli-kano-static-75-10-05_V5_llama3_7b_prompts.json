It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it. If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!
