You get one goal every week to follow, which makes it easy and intuitive. NExt week is dfferent goal. Goals are curated by developers. Also the goals are personalized based on previous use. We may also intregreate receipt item data to even further personalize the goals. \n\nWhat kind of monetization techniques you would suggest?\\nPersona: Hey Vic\\nPersona: Can you do me a small favor?\\nPersona: Can you give me a few danish Tik Tok influencers, ideally 20 - 100K followers, no more\\nPersona: <3\\nPersona: Cause I have no clue, where to start finding them haha\\nFriend: yeah i\u2019ll be right on it haha\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: perfect for another task to do instead of studying\\nFriend: does it count if he is american but makes tik toks about denmark\\nFriend: and being danish\\nPersona: The audience needs to be in denmark/copenhagen\\nPersona: So if thats true, its good\\nPersona: Nicceee thanks\\nPersona: going through them now\\nPersona: those are really good\\nPersona: thank you vic\\nFriend: great! No problem you\u2019re welcome\\nPersona: whats the clotch selling app called?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Patryk called you.\\nPersona: my p2p been doing better last 2 months. 17.8% yearly capital growth equivalent.\\nFriend: Niceee, my 100k just lays on the bank account and I feel like It disappears everyday because of the inflation\\nPersona: Better lose a few percent tha a few tens of percents\\nPersona: Maybe worht the wait\\nPersona: Inves in some ETFs maybe\\nFriend: Maybe\\nFriend: I'm waiting for a good timing\\nPersona: ETFs are like low maintenance and low headache\\nFriend: Seems like ai bubble my burst soon\\nFriend: May\\nPersona: Then maybe invest in non ai companies\\nPersona: if you have the time to find\\nPersona: but you know better\\nFriend: But if ai bubble bursts then overall market will go down as ai is responsible for current bull market\\nPersona: You are probably right\\nFriend: who knows, this bubble can grow for a year or two, or maybe its not a bubble and nVidia is really worth 500USD per share xd\\nPersona: their graphics cards are having very slight improvements in gaming\\nPersona: and big increases in price\\nPersona: seems like their core is not very good\\nFriend: gaming doesn't matter in terms of their value now\\nPersona: why>\\nFriend: its all about AI\\nFriend: their gpu's are best for NLP models\\nPersona: yeah so if it fails, then it will depend on its deep core. Which i gaming, right?\\nFriend: still on AI, as there is plenty of companies who wants to have them for their language models\\nPersona: aaaa\\nPersona: damn 11 laptops\\nPersona: you have to sell them before asia, right?\\nPersona: cause I guess your inventory can depreciate pretty fast\\nPersona: oh, sounds chill then\\nPersona: I keep getting these emails\\nPersona: its so funny\\nPersona: they pretend they are pentagon or some high command political org\\nPersona: like the wording is ridiculously and unneccesarily pretentious\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Fantastic \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019ll make a group chat soon!\\nPersona: Hey Liisa, I just remembered that from April 12, I will be hosting a friend at my place from a week.

You hangout more often?\\nFriend: Bit less than once a week so not too often\\nFriend: I'm pretty excited I'm on the internship and trying to live good but also a bit scared of what comes after it\nto plan a bit \n\nneed to work on the future after a bit\n\nand need a bit of planning\\nFriend: nice you send events and stuff\n\nsocializing is a big part when it comes to making good future plans\\nFriend: if I'm solo, I haven't had good success on future\\nFriend: how the fuck is Kristina in t WSAudiology\\nFriend: did you see her CV?

Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Erkan late 15 20 min he says\\nPersona: whata ur plan?\\nPersona: Whats*\\nFriend: Im chilling at work 2 stops away from there\nIll grab a durum or sometething from netto to eat at dr byen anyways\\nFriend: If you wanna join im free from now\nElse we can meet later too\\nPersona: Hm.

Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Erkan late 15 20 min he says\\nPersona: whata ur plan?\\nPersona: Whats*\\nFriend: Im chilling at work 2 stops away from there\nIll grab a durum or sometething from netto to eat at dr byen anyways\\nFriend: If you wanna join im free from now\nElse we can meet later too\\nPersona: Hm.

Explain why if you think it might be removed by future you\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: this weekend has sucked all the life out of me i am so tired\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: oh dear\\nPersona: the weekend has barely started\\nPersona: well its halfway\\nFriend: we can meet tomorrow would that be good ok?\\nFriend: i will read up on the freaking framing analysis that is confusing me\\nFriend: and then we can do it together tomorrow?\\nPersona: Yeah lets do that\\nFriend: i feel like when we start writing it will take us max 4-5 hours in total\\nFriend: okkk\\nPersona: but I am not sure what you mean the change to framing analysis, so you gotta tell me about that\\nPersona: Cause the analysis that I am doing sort of sort of is starting to make sense\\nPersona: And for me its also pretty clear on what you have to do\\nPersona: In terms of determining their comms strategy\\nFriend: i think we need an analysis model to follow or whatever you call it\\nPersona: Okay go fly, we talk tommorow haha \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: I don't think we need that neccesserily, but yeah we talk tommorow or whenever you are rested and available\\nFriend: look at this tiny ass plane\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Fantastic \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019ll make a group chat soon!\\nPersona: Hey Liisa, I just remembered that from April 12, I will be hosting a friend at my place from a week.

Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done.

Notion is much better.\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\\nPersona: yo wtf\\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\\nPersona: click the three dots\\nPersona: and there is install app button\\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\\nPersona: thats pretty cool\\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\\nPersona: and mortgages\\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\\nPersona: this is from a book\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah i think its too low most likely\\nPersona: maybe it drags over or smth\\nFriend: This looks more correct\\nPersona: but its way over the limit\\nFriend: Maybe its over\\nFriend: Oil expands when its hot\\nFriend: But i guess you checj with cold engine\\nPersona: I tries cold and warm actually\\nPersona: both were above the max by twice the allowed ranges\\nFriend: Well i guess you need to remove excess oil\\nFriend: Annoying\\nFriend: I thought the mechanic would have checked it before it went to the check\\nFriend: Really weird\\nPersona: okay, but since I am leaving for poland and Helene needs the car, i am giving it to her today, I can remove the excess oil only later\\nFriend: On our car it looks like one side has way too much\\nFriend: While the other looks fine\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: Hey Andreas, on Friday my company is doing a \"MarketRun\".

But sometimes its interesting what your mind puts you into, especially when it chooses peolple\\nPersona: Just today I can recall 2 dreams I head\\nPersona: neither fun, neither nightmares. More less fun than fun, I think I save myself in nightmare situations by just dealing with them. I never dream of the cliche demons, etc.\\nPersona: My most common nightmare is brake not working on a car\\nPersona: and the inteteresting thing is that everytime it happens, the car is going slow, usually in a parking lot and i am freaked out of denting someone elses car and mostlt having an awkward situation\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: deall\\nPersona: You started a video chat.\\nPersona: You joined the video chat.\\nFriend: Karla joined the video chat.\\nFriend: Lucas joined the video chat.\\nFriend: finished a meeting now, on my way home\\nFriend: what have i misses\\nFriend: missed*\\nPersona: he most common is net income divided by the total cost of the investment, or ROI = Net income / Cost of investment x 100.

Specially in certain circles\\nFriend: it's kind of the same reason I started dressing better and its a plus in networking\\nFriend: and your partner is an extension of you\\nPersona: numb sounds a bit negative. You just moved in, its actually really common to be homesick in the beginning, you know that\\nFriend: my father has always complained I dressed bad and I know he wouldn't like being seen by others with me in the cases I dress like hobo\n\ncause he has a certain image\\nFriend: he worked hard for.. and i come out dressed funny with beard\\nPersona: but why do you think did it come back now?\\nFriend: i wasn't homesick until today\n\nwas crying cause I hurt 2 friends/dates\\nFriend: think spending time with Laura was good.

So its kind of sad that your parents just have negative opinion because of size\\nPersona: She is not even that big, if you had seeen my coworker or one of my flatmates\\nPersona: they are like actually fucked up big, no cute face could fix it\\nPersona: agree, looks do have some influence and especially for women\\nFriend: true. But they did like her otherwise. After the first week it started getting nice at home\n\nthey treat her like they would treat me\\nPersona: xddd but he was right, you really needed to up your fashion game\\nPersona: and now you did\\nPersona: I remember saying compliments to you recently\\nFriend: I got meat and cheese from home. We can eat soon if you finish exams\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: price went up. Somebody thought somebody did the math\\nPersona: but nobody did the math\\nFriend: exactly\\nPersona: but so many people baught that the buying changed the math itself, so now the math is suddently good anyways\\nPersona: time to write that personal statement. Fuck I hope I can go to sleep soon\\nPersona: I just want to play Rimworld tbh. I think about it before sleep. Literally. Most relaxing thing ever\\nFriend: not stressing? like intensive gameplay\\nFriend: good luck with statement\\nPersona: do you think it is a stressful game?\\nFriend: because im still in learning maybe\\nFriend: so I can't relax\\nFriend: but when I know well whats happening might be different\\nPersona: you mean learning rimworld?\\nPersona: Yeah i heard its a tough to learn game\\nPersona: I don't remember it being tough cause it was a long time ago\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: The most stressfull part is when your best colonist is about to bleed out in 1 hour and you are hoping a medic can patch them up just in time\\nPersona: or when somebody gets an infection and the immunity build up rate has to surpass the infection rate\\nPersona: thats real stress\\nPersona: but I don't think about that\\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is not getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison\\nPersona: I think about my tamed bison running around my beautifully build castly home, leaving homey filth all around and that one colonist on a break down, who stole a smokeleaf joint from a raider and is now getting high in the living room next to the lovely white shitting bison (edited)\\nFriend: sounds unreal\nwhen you describe things like that I imagine it's some Red dead redemption graphics kind of game\\nFriend: but with even more freedom in choice what to do\\nPersona: but you get this graphic\\nPersona: Yoko at the top is smoking\\nFriend: i get this\\nPersona: I like that drop of blood in the middle of the base\\nPersona: it probably sat there for days, because who has time to set it a priority for colonists to clean stuff\\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit in a rain and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood\\nPersona: and it was probably your self-tamed tortoise who got hit during a raid and then ran for safety, leaving this drop of their turtle blood (edited)\\nPersona: I applied to OIE instead of IS\\nPersona: well almost applied\\nPersona: I am confused. I have the legal right for Digital Business masters\\nPersona: so what do I put in the personal statement field. Its required\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: cant wait to hear your opinion about it\\nPersona: xdddd\\nPersona: 180KB/s isnt that bad also xd\\nPersona: okay w8\\nPersona: alright seeding\\nFriend: Don't watch it zddddd\\nPersona: its weird you are not even connected\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: I reannounced\\nPersona: but nobody getting my seed for somr eqson\\nFriend: To the moon\\nPersona: nobody wants my seeed \ud83e\udd71\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude2d\\nFriend: I want your seed\\nFriend: Your huge seed\\nFriend: I want it in me\\nPersona: torrent system is cockblocking my seed \ud83d\ude2a\\nFriend: Xdddd\\nPersona: maybe try to reannounce but idk how it works\\nFriend: Don't know either\\nPersona: I have 3Mb/ps upload speed, you should be done in no time with my seed\\nPersona: i disabled some limit\\nPersona: but still, cant connect to you \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: I have only one guy from Norway\\nPersona: eduroam xddddddddddd\\nPersona: dude setup a distribution at a school\\nFriend: 10X mindset\\nFriend: clearly\\nPersona: its easy VPN, all the fines go to school\\nPersona: i enjoy it\\nFriend: woow I haven't been hyped for anything like for this gadget\\nPersona: omg bro I loved your conversation with Kaja \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: so funny\\nPersona: I am laughing so hard\\nPersona: But damn we notice different things.

But she is definetely ugly without her social reputation and charisma/confidence\\nFriend: weird how it's self feeding\\nPersona: what do you mean self feeding?\\nFriend: feedback loop\n\nthe more social rep/charisma/confidence, the better perceived you are\nand then that boosts it even more\\nFriend: it's so much about perception. Companies and people\\nPersona: yup\\nPersona: like wtf is this\\nPersona: i see this\\nPersona: i run\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude05 reminds me a bit of the one with the long hair\\nFriend: that comes out from the TV\\nFriend: horror movie one\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: yh\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd23 what\\nFriend: why\\nFriend: silly adobe\\nPersona: no clue\\nPersona: I like the car\\nPersona: I need to make big money and get a good car\\nFriend: many pledge allegiance to the GTR\\nFriend: I see you're a fan too\\nPersona: looks nice.

You hangout more often?\\nFriend: Bit less than once a week so not too often\\nFriend: I'm pretty excited I'm on the internship and trying to live good but also a bit scared of what comes after it\nto plan a bit \n\nneed to work on the future after a bit\n\nand need a bit of planning\\nFriend: nice you send events and stuff\n\nsocializing is a big part when it comes to making good future plans\\nFriend: if I'm solo, I haven't had good success on future\\nFriend: how the fuck is Kristina in t WSAudiology\\nFriend: did you see her CV? I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: this weekend has sucked all the life out of me i am so tired\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: oh dear\\nPersona: the weekend has barely started\\nPersona: well its halfway\\nFriend: we can meet tomorrow would that be good ok?\\nFriend: i will read up on the freaking framing analysis that is confusing me\\nFriend: and then we can do it together tomorrow?\\nPersona: Yeah lets do that\\nFriend: i feel like when we start writing it will take us max 4-5 hours in total\\nFriend: okkk\\nPersona: but I am not sure what you mean the change to framing analysis, so you gotta tell me about that\\nPersona: Cause the analysis that I am doing sort of sort of is starting to make sense\\nPersona: And for me its also pretty clear on what you have to do\\nPersona: In terms of determining their comms strategy\\nFriend: i think we need an analysis model to follow or whatever you call it\\nPersona: Okay go fly, we talk tommorow haha \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: I don't think we need that neccesserily, but yeah we talk tommorow or whenever you are rested and available\\nFriend: look at this tiny ass plane\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yeah that would be good\\nFriend: i just don\u2019t understand why it wouldn\u2019t shut down i jammed that turn off button\\nPersona: I would love to see that \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: its weird yeah\\nPersona: there is a startup for horses\\nFriend: uh\\nFriend: what\u2019s the idea\\nFriend: it\u2019s so smart making startup in equine sports bc people are rich and want to spent all their coins in their horses\\nPersona: is your app idea for rich people with horses also?\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: also the poor ones\\nFriend: but it might cater more to ambitious riders\\nFriend: which means their probably have money\\nPersona: okay next time lets talk about your billion dollar idea\\nFriend: yeahhh\\nPersona: We have this business idea for bite-sized finance goals.

Like 5 love languages for autists?\\nFriend: ye :DD\\nFriend: you remember I keep asking to meet and just study together or do our thing but separately\\nFriend: the exact thing is stated as one of them\\nFriend: idk.. would have to test on people if they identify with any of these to see\\nPersona: But why?\\nPersona: Like what does it mean? does it mean that if you like that, you are autistic? I don't think it means that\\nPersona: let me see the rest\\nPersona: Umm but not everything is love, there is also friendship. Maybe if you did the parallel play/body doubling with a girl as a way to express love, maybe then it would fit.\\nFriend: eh.. I think you can express love language with friends, no?\\nPersona: okay maybe thats true, the love languages seem to be more general\\nPersona: the Neurodivergent Love Languages I quickly read through kinda seem fine and normal to me. Maybe world has started to appear more and more fake normal. Or maybe I am autistic xd\\nFriend: ye I'm not sure about you. Need to perform research on others\\nPersona: okay, this may be totally wrong, but maybe you don't act enough? Like when I got out of this no lifer stage of my life, I just kinda acted it out all the time and it then grew on me. Right now I am always trying to act the person that I want to be (a combination of multiple people from real life, TV, moviest, stories). I also sometimes consciously think about it. But in the end it works\\nPersona: If you think you are weird, then I am of the belief that socializing is a muscle and if you train it, it's impossible not to grow it. If there is autism involved, then idk how it works, but maybe its also solvable.\\nFriend: ye. It's not that autism is a drawback, but a different way of working\n\nbetter at one thing, worse at another\n\nso socializing is hard with normies\\nFriend: and yeah because socializing is like you say a muscle, harder to diagnose if you are autist and not normie\\nPersona: better at one thing worse at another is also not neccesarily autism. Lets say you are smart and inteligent, but less good at social. This can be because you just spent more time learning and thinking and less time for socializing.\\nPersona: Do you think that you tried socializing more and more and you didn't feel that you got better?\\nFriend: I definitely got better\nbut autism prolly is real \ni imagine like a predisposition to some stuff\\nFriend: but not necessarily strictly bad at it\\nPersona: its good then, maybe its just a matter of lack of socailization then.\\nPersona: I mean, healthcare is free, just get a test or something. When they say you don't have it, life may become so much easier. Just the confirmation from a doctor that smth is normal helped me so much a few times.\\nFriend: that's also what would be part of the finding if I find if I am autistic or not\n\nbecause it would prove if experiences play a role in it or is it a thing you just have/ have not\\nFriend: was acting like a bipolar person in covid summer because of stress\\nFriend: but I am not (usually) acting on emotion or like that\\nPersona: Did you suddenly get really worried about this or you been thinking about this what you are saying for a while now?\\nFriend: thinking a little \n\never since you said everyone is on the spectrum\\nPersona: Maybe my scale of 'normaliness' ir calibrated a little bit different, cause I view mood swings kinda normal. But idk to what extent you had them.\\nPersona: fuck I may have said that. If I said it then, I probably shounnt've because as you can see I am not really knowledgable about it when its real talk\\nFriend: :D yeah idk much about it either. Never researched\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Patryk called you.\\nPersona: my p2p been doing better last 2 months. 17.8% yearly capital growth equivalent.\\nFriend: Niceee, my 100k just lays on the bank account and I feel like It disappears everyday because of the inflation\\nPersona: Better lose a few percent tha a few tens of percents\\nPersona: Maybe worht the wait\\nPersona: Inves in some ETFs maybe\\nFriend: Maybe\\nFriend: I'm waiting for a good timing\\nPersona: ETFs are like low maintenance and low headache\\nFriend: Seems like ai bubble my burst soon\\nFriend: May\\nPersona: Then maybe invest in non ai companies\\nPersona: if you have the time to find\\nPersona: but you know better\\nFriend: But if ai bubble bursts then overall market will go down as ai is responsible for current bull market\\nPersona: You are probably right\\nFriend: who knows, this bubble can grow for a year or two, or maybe its not a bubble and nVidia is really worth 500USD per share xd\\nPersona: their graphics cards are having very slight improvements in gaming\\nPersona: and big increases in price\\nPersona: seems like their core is not very good\\nFriend: gaming doesn't matter in terms of their value now\\nPersona: why>\\nFriend: its all about AI\\nFriend: their gpu's are best for NLP models\\nPersona: yeah so if it fails, then it will depend on its deep core. Which i gaming, right?\\nFriend: still on AI, as there is plenty of companies who wants to have them for their language models\\nPersona: aaaa\\nPersona: damn 11 laptops\\nPersona: you have to sell them before asia, right?\\nPersona: cause I guess your inventory can depreciate pretty fast\\nPersona: oh, sounds chill then\\nPersona: I keep getting these emails\\nPersona: its so funny\\nPersona: they pretend they are pentagon or some high command political org\\nPersona: like the wording is ridiculously and unneccesarily pretentious\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah i think its too low most likely\\nPersona: maybe it drags over or smth\\nFriend: This looks more correct\\nPersona: but its way over the limit\\nFriend: Maybe its over\\nFriend: Oil expands when its hot\\nFriend: But i guess you checj with cold engine\\nPersona: I tries cold and warm actually\\nPersona: both were above the max by twice the allowed ranges\\nFriend: Well i guess you need to remove excess oil\\nFriend: Annoying\\nFriend: I thought the mechanic would have checked it before it went to the check\\nFriend: Really weird\\nPersona: okay, but since I am leaving for poland and Helene needs the car, i am giving it to her today, I can remove the excess oil only later\\nFriend: On our car it looks like one side has way too much\\nFriend: While the other looks fine\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: Hey Andreas, on Friday my company is doing a \"MarketRun\". Basically it means that we are meeting the market, talking to friends, family, etc. to get feedback on our product. Would you be up for a meeting some point on Friday? For lunch, coffee or even a beer with me and my colleage Aaron. It should be during working hours so perhaps at your office or your place if you work from home? I wrote to Juste aswell, but we can have separate meetings\\nPersona: Hey, so I forgot to confirm, 10 at your place tommorow for the demo?\\nFriend: Yeah\\nFriend: 10:15\\nFriend: Maybe\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: Is 11:30 okay?\\nPersona: sorry\\nPersona: 10:30\\nPersona: misclick\\nPersona: 10:30***\\nFriend: Thats cool\\nPersona: 10:40, we a bit late\\nPersona: we won the market run\\nFriend: Congrats!

If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: deall\\nPersona: You started a video chat.\\nPersona: You joined the video chat.\\nFriend: Karla joined the video chat.\\nFriend: Lucas joined the video chat.\\nFriend: finished a meeting now, on my way home\\nFriend: what have i misses\\nFriend: missed*\\nPersona: he most common is net income divided by the total cost of the investment, or ROI = Net income / Cost of investment x 100. As an example, take a person who invested $90 into a business venture and spent an additional $10 researching the venture.\\nFriend: We just went through the slides, discussing calculations and questions the judges might ask us, in terms of what we need to research, specifically concerning how big the market potential actually is in numbers.\\nPersona: command crocodile does not work on my mac \ud83d\ude2d\\nFriend: noo I\u2019ll show you on saturday\\nPersona: yess please do hah\\nPersona: We are calling at 15:00?\\nFriend: I am not able to attend, sorry \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: I am a bit stuck with my group. What about 15:30?\\nFriend: ^ we\u2019re still with the studygroup\\nFriend: I won\u2019t make it today because of an arrangement with the study\\nFriend: But ready for tmrww\\nFriend: I made my manuscript\\nFriend: Ill be there around 11.10\\nFriend: I\u2019ll come in more casual clothing and then change at CSE before going to FED\\nFriend: Just fyi haha - wasn\u2019t sure if we went home before going to FED\\nFriend: i will dress for the evening\\nFriend: I am wearing my fancy blazer\\nPersona: I will just take a button shirt I think\\nFriend: i will come at around 12/13 if thats okey\\nFriend: Do you have your manuacript so we know? Otherwise it doesn\u2019t makes sense to meet up until then\\nFriend: Should I just make a draft for your slides Maja?\\nFriend: Yes thats fine lucas, thank you very much\\nFriend: Great!\\nFriend: It\u2019s just that then we could work on once own from home\\nFriend: Because what do we meet up for if we\u2019re not all together? Just to be sure \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Questions from judges\\nFriend: engineer don't dress up"

Im not sure, depends how everyone are feeling etc\\nPersona: alrihht, I had signed up for Saunagus at 20:00 haha, so I think I will have to skip the sauna\\nPersona: cause if I go to sauna I would come only at around 22\\nFriend: Hmmm\\nFriend: Yeah think it would be bit late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Patryk called you.\\nPersona: my p2p been doing better last 2 months. 17.8% yearly capital growth equivalent.\\nFriend: Niceee, my 100k just lays on the bank account and I feel like It disappears everyday because of the inflation\\nPersona: Better lose a few percent tha a few tens of percents\\nPersona: Maybe worht the wait\\nPersona: Inves in some ETFs maybe\\nFriend: Maybe\\nFriend: I'm waiting for a good timing\\nPersona: ETFs are like low maintenance and low headache\\nFriend: Seems like ai bubble my burst soon\\nFriend: May\\nPersona: Then maybe invest in non ai companies\\nPersona: if you have the time to find\\nPersona: but you know better\\nFriend: But if ai bubble bursts then overall market will go down as ai is responsible for current bull market\\nPersona: You are probably right\\nFriend: who knows, this bubble can grow for a year or two, or maybe its not a bubble and nVidia is really worth 500USD per share xd\\nPersona: their graphics cards are having very slight improvements in gaming\\nPersona: and big increases in price\\nPersona: seems like their core is not very good\\nFriend: gaming doesn't matter in terms of their value now\\nPersona: why>\\nFriend: its all about AI\\nFriend: their gpu's are best for NLP models\\nPersona: yeah so if it fails, then it will depend on its deep core. Which i gaming, right?\\nFriend: still on AI, as there is plenty of companies who wants to have them for their language models\\nPersona: aaaa\\nPersona: damn 11 laptops\\nPersona: you have to sell them before asia, right?\\nPersona: cause I guess your inventory can depreciate pretty fast\\nPersona: oh, sounds chill then\\nPersona: I keep getting these emails\\nPersona: its so funny\\nPersona: they pretend they are pentagon or some high command political org\\nPersona: like the wording is ridiculously and unneccesarily pretentious\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Airi! \nIf you feel celebrating with others I can give a hand and help setup\nWh\\nPersona: Before I had an idea to host a great party at juste place like always with many people, but I though its too much for this time, already feeling too busy, maybe next year a big great party again \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: on my birthday I love to hang out with you though maybe just chill time. Wish Patryk was here too\\nPersona: not feeling like hanging out with anyone from CBS though\\nPersona: if we stay at my dorm then I could also invite the the ukrainian dude with his wife\\nPersona: Now I am thinking about cake xd\\nPersona: I will buy some nice cake from Meny\\nPersona: Ok now I am thinking about just a casual hang out in my kitchen \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Maybe would be pretty nice to invite Kuba, Lu, maybe Ivan. But I am not feeling like I want much attention\\nPersona: I want a low key chill evening xd\\nPersona: but maybe that would work\\nFriend: St Patricks day today\\nFriend: What you up to\\nPersona: work\\nPersona: then relax home after\\nFriend: Wanna relax witb beer?\\nFriend: I got cold one in fridge\\nPersona: I just got six pack from Kuba also xdd\\nPersona: made a trade cookies to beer\\nPersona: What are your plans?\\nFriend: Im omw home from work\nChill \nWork\nEat\nIm free to do anytging\\nPersona: where would be the best option to watch a film?\\nPersona: I feel like TV's have become so scarce\\nPersona: i need to check if cinema free after I finish work\\nFriend: Yeah thatd be best\\nFriend: Tv cheaper than monitor tho\\nPersona: okay I finally decided to end work\\nPersona: my mind feela so heavy ugh\\nPersona: will check the cinema\\nPersona: fuck\\nPersona: there is this tv tho\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\\nPersona: blowing air?\\nFriend: My emotes look different\\nFriend: That tv looks small from far\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell.

Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth?

I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\\nPersona: yo wtf\\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\\nPersona: click the three dots\\nPersona: and there is install app button\\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\\nPersona: thats pretty cool\\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\\nPersona: and mortgages\\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things.

Like these days, right now? Is it only about girls or including boys?\\nPersona: then so many of us may have autism and we are just pretending to act normal lol\\nPersona: Cause honestly, I do act a lot of stuff to reach my goals or make an impression to some person\\nPersona: Maybe I am also an autist then\\nPersona: I don't really know, I think I know too little about it.\\nPersona: for me the better understanding is the word 'weird'\\nFriend: yeah \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nthe thing that prompted me to be curious now is the 5 love languages\\nFriend: have you heard of that thing\\nPersona: is it like words, touch, and some 3 more?\\nFriend: yee ye!\\nFriend: but then there are these 5 others and I'm questioning if those 5 others are the ones for autists\\nFriend: or if normal people can also identify with them\\nPersona: 5 others.

But I guess prestige is also, infamously, important\\nPersona: How long can CBS motivational letter be?\\nPersona: For my 2nd priority I can;t decide between:\nMSc in Economics and BA -\u00a0Management of Innovation and Business Development \nMSc in Social Science - Organisational Innovation and Entrepreneurship (maybe too stupid that it is totally a social science and the people did look stupid in there during open days)\nMSc in\u00a0BA Information Systems  (an honorable option always)\\nPersona: I put them in the way I am leaning towards and maybe thats how I will apply\\nFriend: I think this is a pretty good read for people trying to get good at this\\nPersona: Nice, I must read it\\nPersona: fuck, the program MSc in Economics and BA - Management of Innovation and Business Development\\nPersona: is so good\\nPersona: look at the topic map\\nPersona: The entrepreneuship master at CBS I am starting to hate it\\nPersona: I feel its full of stupid people\\nPersona: like at work, some are from them\\nPersona: they are fucking stupid\\nPersona: they were discussing some of their friends startups during lunch\\nPersona: they were so stupid\\nPersona: And most people dont end up making startups there\\nPersona: the startup founding rate at the DTU course is 100% lol\\nPersona: I think I will apply to the innovation one for 2nd prio, IS for 3rd prio and Digital busines for 4th, so I have the legal right in case.\\nPersona: But if it get to the 4th prio I might aswell then reject it and go to military to rethink if thats really where I want to waste my year of SU\\nFriend: You can do 2 bachelors and 1 master on SU so not a big waste\nBut yeah..\\nFriend: Feel like my current class is a lot like KEA\\nFriend: Many ppl that don't seem good\\nFriend: I was in group with 2 girls and for our presentation they just read their notes\\nFriend: I lose motivation like that\n\nBut there are also good ppl. Some asked me questions after so imma talk to them\\nPersona: dont u have just 6 years total?\\nPersona: Really? in what way?\\nPersona: digital business is not a very random course it has some agenda that would deter the stupid people\\nPersona: Atleast I think\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: shti I should read full messages before asking a questipn xdd\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah i think its too low most likely\\nPersona: maybe it drags over or smth\\nFriend: This looks more correct\\nPersona: but its way over the limit\\nFriend: Maybe its over\\nFriend: Oil expands when its hot\\nFriend: But i guess you checj with cold engine\\nPersona: I tries cold and warm actually\\nPersona: both were above the max by twice the allowed ranges\\nFriend: Well i guess you need to remove excess oil\\nFriend: Annoying\\nFriend: I thought the mechanic would have checked it before it went to the check\\nFriend: Really weird\\nPersona: okay, but since I am leaving for poland and Helene needs the car, i am giving it to her today, I can remove the excess oil only later\\nFriend: On our car it looks like one side has way too much\\nFriend: While the other looks fine\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: Hey Andreas, on Friday my company is doing a \"MarketRun\". Basically it means that we are meeting the market, talking to friends, family, etc. to get feedback on our product. Would you be up for a meeting some point on Friday? For lunch, coffee or even a beer with me and my colleage Aaron. It should be during working hours so perhaps at your office or your place if you work from home? I wrote to Juste aswell, but we can have separate meetings\\nPersona: Hey, so I forgot to confirm, 10 at your place tommorow for the demo?\\nFriend: Yeah\\nFriend: 10:15\\nFriend: Maybe\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: Is 11:30 okay?\\nPersona: sorry\\nPersona: 10:30\\nPersona: misclick\\nPersona: 10:30***\\nFriend: Thats cool\\nPersona: 10:40, we a bit late\\nPersona: we won the market run\\nFriend: Congrats! We will have to manage with this\\nPersona: Xdd whats this?\\nPersona: your trophy?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Try to be more conscise and less generic. Sometimes you are well conscise, but some sentences are bloated with sophisticated words that tell nothing. You are talking to IT, innovation people - they value consciseness. Especially the introduction and ending are written in a very different style from the rest of the text.\n\nAlso do some proofreading to try to improve the sentence structure and flow (perhaps a evening read with Kaja could work?), choose a consistency with capitalization.\n\nIn some sentences, you don't appear fully commited, I marked those. I think you should leave no doubts.\\nPersona: it didn't work for me to leave comments in your doc\\nPersona: so I made a copy\\nFriend: Do I talk to IT people? I thought it's readed by admission people who doesn't know much about IT and they just try to find some key words xd\\nPersona: Hm. Not 100% sure, but it would make sense that it is read by the head of studeis\\nPersona: studies*\\nPersona: or by people in that field at least\\nPersona: But not sure\\nFriend: yeah but those uncomitted were about BEIT, I think I show the comitment about IS\\nPersona: It would be stupid if an application a subject is evaluated by people who have no understanding in the subject\\nFriend: that's how most of the HR works xdd\\nFriend: Thanks man it helps a lot, your feedback is as always profound and on place ;*\\nFriend: on point*\\nPersona: no problem man\\nPersona: We will make it to our dream progams <3\\nFriend: we will  <3\\nFriend: do you apply only at DTU?\\nPersona: DTU first choice\\nPersona: then CBS if it does not workout\\nFriend: what you apply for?\\nPersona: Technology Entrepreneurship\\nFriend: alright all in entrepreneurship\\nFriend: you won't regret it\\nFriend: Can't wait to see your first product live ;*\\nFriend: or maybe I should say your first baby <3\\nPersona: xdddd\\nPersona: lets not call startups babies\\nPersona: I have to make sure I make it in to the program\\nPersona: I will try hard\\nPersona: I already met the head of studies\\nPersona: talked with her\\nFriend: you will, I don't think that there is much applicants with background like yours\\nPersona: made sure she remmebers me\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: uuu\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: this song is so good\\nFriend: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nFriend: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nFriend: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nPersona: Hey, looked at the email now\\nPersona: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nPersona: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nPersona: He looks pretty old\\nPersona: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nPersona: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nPersona: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nPersona: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nPersona: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nPersona: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nPersona: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nPersona: This could be huge\\nPersona: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nPersona: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nPersona: thats what I lvoe\\nPersona: love*\\nPersona: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nPersona: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nFriend: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nPersona: no worries I was also slow\\nPersona: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nPersona: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nFriend: And also one in the evening, right?\\nPersona: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nPersona: I literally cant find the email\\nFriend: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nPersona: yeah I agree\\nFriend: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nPersona: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its same walkinf as metri\\nFriend: I wont walk to noereport\\nPersona: yh ik\\nPersona: hope it gets solved\\nFriend: Its starting\\nFriend: Its genius system\n\nStop metro\nLook at cameras\nWhen enough people come out\nStart again\\nPersona: xdd why?\\nFriend: Just troll ppl\\nFriend: Noerreport now\nComing im 15\\nFriend: Here\\nPersona: yo\\nPersona: come to threathre\\nPersona: sorry i met some VIP guests\\nFriend: Ye im there\\nFriend: Followed the crowd\\nFriend: This is big\\nPersona: good\\nFriend: The tech part is super interesting but im out of energy\\nPersona: yeah, was nice\\nPersona: honestly, the co-founder in a suit is a bit boring imo\\nPersona: He could be more dynamic\\nFriend: Half ppl ran away\n\nShouldn't leave best for last\n\nThe spots thing and embed codes ppl relate to\nShould be one.of the first\\nFriend: And the cto doing good job trying to make it relatable\\nFriend: So people can get the meaning\\nFriend: They can use the footage from.today to figure out which parts are good or bad imo\\nFriend: Peeking at the cute host? \ud83d\ude04\\nPersona: Agreed prob\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: wdym?\\nPersona: xd\\nPersona: Amelia?

Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting. I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options.

So I would like to bring him too, would that be fine?\\nFriend: Of course!!\\nPersona: Okay, geat \u2764\\nPersona: hey hey, how long are you planing on staying in the bar and overall hanging out?\\nFriend: Hey! Im not sure, depends how everyone are feeling etc\\nPersona: alrihht, I had signed up for Saunagus at 20:00 haha, so I think I will have to skip the sauna\\nPersona: cause if I go to sauna I would come only at around 22\\nFriend: Hmmm\\nFriend: Yeah think it would be bit late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: is it like words, touch, and some 3 more?\\nFriend: yee ye!\\nFriend: but then there are these 5 others and I'm questioning if those 5 others are the ones for autists\\nFriend: or if normal people can also identify with them\\nPersona: 5 others. Like 5 love languages for autists?\\nFriend: ye :DD\\nFriend: you remember I keep asking to meet and just study together or do our thing but separately\\nFriend: the exact thing is stated as one of them\\nFriend: idk.. would have to test on people if they identify with any of these to see\\nPersona: But why?\\nPersona: Like what does it mean? does it mean that if you like that, you are autistic? I don't think it means that\\nPersona: let me see the rest\\nPersona: Umm but not everything is love, there is also friendship. Maybe if you did the parallel play/body doubling with a girl as a way to express love, maybe then it would fit.\\nFriend: eh.. I think you can express love language with friends, no?\\nPersona: okay maybe thats true, the love languages seem to be more general\\nPersona: the Neurodivergent Love Languages I quickly read through kinda seem fine and normal to me. Maybe world has started to appear more and more fake normal. Or maybe I am autistic xd\\nFriend: ye I'm not sure about you. Need to perform research on others\\nPersona: okay, this may be totally wrong, but maybe you don't act enough? Like when I got out of this no lifer stage of my life, I just kinda acted it out all the time and it then grew on me. Right now I am always trying to act the person that I want to be (a combination of multiple people from real life, TV, moviest, stories). I also sometimes consciously think about it. But in the end it works\\nPersona: If you think you are weird, then I am of the belief that socializing is a muscle and if you train it, it's impossible not to grow it. If there is autism involved, then idk how it works, but maybe its also solvable.\\nFriend: ye. It's not that autism is a drawback, but a different way of working\n\nbetter at one thing, worse at another\n\nso socializing is hard with normies\\nFriend: and yeah because socializing is like you say a muscle, harder to diagnose if you are autist and not normie\\nPersona: better at one thing worse at another is also not neccesarily autism. Lets say you are smart and inteligent, but less good at social. This can be because you just spent more time learning and thinking and less time for socializing.\\nPersona: Do you think that you tried socializing more and more and you didn't feel that you got better?\\nFriend: I definitely got better\nbut autism prolly is real \ni imagine like a predisposition to some stuff\\nFriend: but not necessarily strictly bad at it\\nPersona: its good then, maybe its just a matter of lack of socailization then.\\nPersona: I mean, healthcare is free, just get a test or something. When they say you don't have it, life may become so much easier. Just the confirmation from a doctor that smth is normal helped me so much a few times.\\nFriend: that's also what would be part of the finding if I find if I am autistic or not\n\nbecause it would prove if experiences play a role in it or is it a thing you just have/ have not\\nFriend: was acting like a bipolar person in covid summer because of stress\\nFriend: but I am not (usually) acting on emotion or like that\\nPersona: Did you suddenly get really worried about this or you been thinking about this what you are saying for a while now?\\nFriend: thinking a little \n\never since you said everyone is on the spectrum\\nPersona: Maybe my scale of 'normaliness' ir calibrated a little bit different, cause I view mood swings kinda normal. But idk to what extent you had them.\\nPersona: fuck I may have said that. If I said it then, I probably shounnt've because as you can see I am not really knowledgable about it when its real talk\\nFriend: :D yeah idk much about it either. Never researched"

Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth?

And then I noticed a another 2A bus literally behind the bus. And usually the second bus is emptier. So when they both stopped I ran of the first 2A bus into the second 2A. Driver gave me a confusing look haha\\nFriend: i signed up for mentor program at cbs a year ago\n\ni go to intro meeting\n\nthey say they will contact us with further details\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I don't remember who I talked with but seems like flutter is being used more\\nFriend: was something job related\\nPersona: I heard ita growing, but looks like react native is still more popular\\nPersona: by the way, yesterday the police pulled me over in the middle of the city xdd\\nPersona: had my first pullover with flashers\\nPersona: danish police turned out pretty nice tho\\nFriend: what happened\\nFriend: what they asked\\nPersona: I technically ran a red light\\nPersona: It was night, I was a bit distracted and I saw the red light a bit to late so I stopped a little bit beyond the end of the pedestrian crossing on a big intersection.\\nPersona: As soon as I look to my rear end mirror so I can see if there is space to reverse, I saw that a police car was right behind me lol\\nPersona: then once we passed the busy intersection they pulled me over, I was sweating, I thought I will get an expensive danish fine\\nPersona: but after doing all the casual alcohol, license checking\\nPersona: they just reeducated me about not ggoing beyond the stop line, I apoligized a couple of time and let me go. no fine\\nPersona: I looked up later, for running red light fine is 2000 kr\\nFriend: what a nice stop\\nFriend: just police doing their thing\\nFriend: making sure you aren't drunk and just carry on with their business\\nFriend: yooo\nI set up image generating AI locally\n\nsomeone made a ready to use local server and UI - InvokeAI\nit's using stable diffusion underneath\\nFriend: I wrote \"cute red head\" and expected to get results similar to midjourney\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: is it 100% local?\\nFriend: but instead I got this \ud83e\udd23\\nFriend: looks like a porn intro\\nFriend: yeah local\\nFriend: lots of GB tho\\nPersona: but thats not too bad\\nPersona: but thats still pretty cool. Someone just gave away lots of data\\nPersona: how long does it take to generate?\\nFriend: seconds\\nFriend: like 10\\nPersona: hm okay\\nPersona: So i guess the online image gem servers are then either super optimized or super costly\\nPersona: cause thats still a bit\\nPersona: and you have a good pc\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh\\nFriend: will make one this week then!\nHave to go back to real life :c\\nPersona: But yo\u0161 would need different design them\\nPersona: its actually very simple, big dark area, falling a specific number if blocks\\nFriend: cat I know scares creeper\\nPersona: then you one hit them with a hand\\nFriend: and villager attracts zombie\nor spawns golems if he hears/sees zombie\\nPersona: yeah, that makea golems spawn, but if you want to make an iron ingot and rosr farm, you will need a differnt design\\nPersona: a very funny one with many doors\\nFriend: with doors? man where you get your designs from?\\nFriend: I looked at a dude making a 99.98% efficient farm (he was counting game ticks and everything)\\nPersona: 10+ years of expeience bro xd\\nFriend: but he had to send them to the nether\\nFriend: show me door design iron farm\\nFriend: first time i hear\\nFriend: is it with gates?\\nFriend: cause i used gates xD doors would be funny af\\nPersona: Atleast that  was back in the day, now maybe there are new ones\\nPersona: cause mc got so updated\\nFriend: wth looks like a scary meat grinder\\nPersona: its a metal grinder xd\\nFriend: now the iron golem is with a trapped zombie mid\nand some villagers on the sides watching it\\nFriend: then the rest is like the farm you showed first\n\ndrag golems down to lava\\nFriend: just watched the vid :D interesting design\\nFriend: actually doors\\nPersona: damn I dind;t know guardian farms exists\\nPersona: iron golem spawner lol\\nPersona: thats not vannila\\nPersona: Its lietrally free\\nFriend: no it's not\\nFriend: but pretty good \ndoesn't require villagers or anything\\nFriend: but it took lots of farming to buy\\nFriend: ty\nthis good\\nFriend: I wanted to play skyblock duo a lot\n\nI don't like skyblock\n\nI was there when it was getting popular\\nFriend: but now it's possible! some servers offer\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but I do stand corrected. it may be kind of possible\\nFriend: the technique is actually legit. recently used for mood improvement. pretty cool\\nFriend: the lucid dream part is more tricky. seems that til now only 1 study from 2012 succesfully captured the difference between REM and lucid-REM. and they recruited 4 experienced lucid dreamers, and still only 1 had a lucid dream in the scanner lol + the activated network is pretty dispersed\\nFriend: skimmed through a recent meta analysis. most attempts to induce lucid dreams failed. only in one with transcranial stimulation they had a mild effect, but only in experienced lucid dreamers. interestingly galantimine (AD medication) induced lucid dreams in 42% inexperienced people vs 17% in placebo group\\nFriend: but feasibility aside, it seems a bit risky. we don't even fully understand what REM and dreams are for, but we do know that deficiency in REM is associated with increased death rate, so it's not sth I would really fuck with for funsies\\nFriend: *oops galantamine and 14%, not 17%\\nFriend: yup, soft d is a beauty. can kind of hear it, but no clue how to produce it\\nFriend: I've seen quite a lot. strangely enough, not Breaking Bad. would say Peaky Blinders, Hannibal and Mr Robot are my top 3. fairly recently I've watched Succession and also loved it\\nFriend: woah why is this so specific? are you referencing something?\ud83d\ude33\\nPersona: which vid are you reffering to, the academia pyramid one?\\nPersona: Lucid dreaming? You can do it often?\\nPersona: damn you went to the rabbit hole\\nPersona: I merely skimmed, the article and sent it, cause I thought it would interest you, and here we go, Joanna at 2 AM haha\\nPersona: be careful not to miss your REM sleep, I swear, someone just literally told me it can lead to increased death rate\\nPersona: Peaky Blinders were always on my watch it, but I never watched it\\nPersona: its meta programming. I think among the top expensive programming errors included a mid-air space rocket explosion. If I remember it correctly it was because someone mixed up imperial and metric units \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: but I invented the part with strongly typed language, but I am sure typos have also lead to some other expensive errors\\nPersona: Actually, I just watched a movie and thought about lucid dreaming. Its really cool that a brain can simulate a world in you mind with actual senses and when one can guide what happens in the world, its even better\\nPersona: I only lucid dream a few times, but I noticed, that yes, I can control what happens in the dream, but I can't invent new real knowledge, it's simply just physically impossible. If I try to travel to a place I never been or experience something I never did, the parts of that experience that I have experienced in real life will be simulated, but parts that I never will sort of a try to be substituted, combined, imagines with existing experiences that I have had. It really sort of reminds me how AI and neural networks work\\nPersona: And I thought about it right now, because having 1 life in the present is god damn limiting. I am sometimes fascinated by different cultures, like I always wondered what it would be like to be true punk ahahah, life fuck education, career and just live a punk life, One can't really 'try it out', you have to give it a lot of life. And then I even went into the extremes of being curious what a life experience of a skinhead in 60s - 90s would be like. I am just curious to experience it without consequences to the real world\\nPersona: Actually I have this theory, that the almost a century developed digital graphics and the more recent digital VR technology curve will be disrupted by dreaming based experiences. Brain can simulate a full dive virtual reality natively, while we are currently struggling with expensive and barely realistic haptic suits, limited field of view, etc.\\nPersona: ugh I have this course now called Research Methods and its basically a course about academia. I don't think I am made for this haha \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: nej, in the article you linked there's an X post from that company, and it contains a 10 min vid where the CEO explains what the deal is\\nFriend: nono, that ultrasound brain stimulation technique\\nFriend: seems like lucid dreaming could have some potential for PTSD treatment though, I've noticed quite a few articles about it, but haven't read. for this reason it would be really cool for a device like this to exist, but I think the aim here is commercial use, which I'm not the fan of\\nFriend: I've been thinking about it a lot for the past few days actually haha\\nFriend: you know what, I think you'd like it. I also need to rewatch it sometime because I haven't seen the last season and I don't remember what happened by that  point, but I just need to commit to waste of 40h of my life I'm never going to get back. haven't come to terms with it yet\\nFriend: ah okay yes, it does ring a bell\\nFriend: what movie?\\nFriend: oh I'm so with you on this one. thogh it's sad because even lucid dreaming wouldn't give you that experience. you'd only sense your own idea of what a life like this would look like\\nFriend: it does sound probable. but as a neuro person the prospect scares me a lot\\nFriend: what are your research methods? because based on the business papers I've read, you just do A LOT of polls and stuff\\nPersona: ahh, I will watch it in abit\\nPersona: okay, I really need to watch it then, because now I imagine you having a huge ultrasound brain stimulation throne in your room, but I am sure its not that haha\\nPersona: ahh you are very kind again with your altruistic intentions. I am thinking about it purely for entertainment, gaming purposes xd\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats pretty disturbing\\nPersona: Reallly?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Fuck, okay I gotta rethink\\nFriend: my sister was really sick one with her liver and literally even 2 years after the doctors still advised her not to drink it\\nPersona: Ah fuck you are right\\nPersona: I just Googled it\\nFriend: hahaha\\nFriend: yeha\\nPersona: You may have saved my liver in the long run, thanks <3\\nFriend: its scary\\nPersona: but now its up to me to change it\\nPersona: but wtf, why we can't have nice things\\nPersona: Energy drinks literally makes me happy\\nFriend: but i mean i drink a fuck ton of coke so i am not that mich better myself\\nFriend: hahahah\\nPersona: is it sugarfree?\\nFriend: youre very welcome\\nFriend: depends on my mood\\nFriend: i mean i have learned that sugar free is actually better than the zer sugar ones\\nPersona: so when do you drink with sugar and when without haha?\\nPersona: Vic\\nPersona: I think your brain crashed\\nFriend: sugar is for when i either feel a headache coming or if a need extra gas for my brain\\nFriend: ahhaha oh i see\\nFriend: i meant the other way\\nPersona: You said sugar free is better than zero sugar\\nFriend: sugar is better than sugar free\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: lord jesus i need to do smomthing else that sit by my damn computer\\nPersona: But that depends on your goals\\nPersona: Cause like sugary drinks give acne, but maybe the sugarfree ones are worse for teeth idk\\nPersona: Should we get back to lovely do?\\nFriend: no bc there is some chemical in the sugar free onces that is seriously bad for u and accumulates in your body bc its really hard to get rid off\\nFriend: haha yeah\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yeah, I am looking at these two programming courses now\\nPersona: They actually look pretty cool, I think they would really deepen understanding of how software is built. Its CBS level of progamming, and I remember you told me a few times, you wanted to learn to develop an app, well these course are in that theme. It seems that in the second one you would be building a web app actually. If my colleague taking this course could do the first one with minimal whinning, then I am pretty sure you can do it for sure and easier haha\\nPersona: By CBS level I mean, it will not be very difficult I assume.\\nPersona: For the first course I can of course help you if you need\\nPersona: Don't need to buy me haha\\nPersona: For the second one most likely too, at least for the front-end. I haven't done much back-end, but I'll gladly learn along with you if I don't learn it by then haha\\nFriend: Thank you so much Airi!\\nFriend: i am still not sure what to pick hahaha\\nFriend: but if i do that one it would be so great to have your help\\nFriend: i\u2019m glad i don\u2019t need to buy u haha\\nPersona: If you need to hear from a person who study in a particular CBS course, let me know, I can connect you\\nFriend: it would be really cool to be able to do it\\nFriend: really? why?\\nFriend: it\u2019s a lil late not I need so submit it tomorrow but i think i will do it tonight\\nPersona: In case you want feedback on the course\\nFriend: no but why can you connect me?\\nPersona: yeah I am also lasy day'ing everything\\nFriend: can i leave my car for parking overnight at CBs?\\nPersona: I mean like give their contacts to you and give them a heads up\\nPersona: If you have a student parking permit there, then yeah\\nPersona: I left it multiple times, too drunk to drive home haha\\nFriend: but why do you know them i mean hahaha\\nFriend: oh\\nFriend: okay thanks!\\nPersona: I guess for everyone of them its a different story ahaha\\nPersona: Some are colleagues, some friends, some that I met on some event\\nFriend: i\u2019m kind of scared\\nFriend: i am counting on you to help me now hah\\nPersona: I will help where I can <3\\nPersona: Did you end up applying to it as 1st prio?\\nFriend: yes \ud83d\ude2c\\nFriend: idk i think the classes are something that actually interests me where ones from my second options were more boring and basic\\nFriend: i just wanted it bc it\u2019s seemed more easy for me\\nPersona: DB is nice, I would probably have put it higher in priorities too, but I applied for DTU course first\\nPersona: What was the other one you were considering?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: Would you be up for a 7 - 10 daytrip to Chalupy around 15 - 30 July?\\nPersona: Chalupy is a beautiful peninsula in Poland, close to Gdansk. Nice beaches, sun, maybe kite-surfing, maybe a weekend of fun in Warsaw also\\nPersona: No precise day set, but we got Patryk and my other Polish bud on board\\nFriend: you can book a shelter and see which are free\\nFriend: the one with arrow is closest to Mons Klint\\nFriend: above that is Koge\nand on the left Naestved\nI think it would be easy to find sankt hans there\\nFriend: it's hard wood and chilly at night but can sleep good\n\nprice I think is like 50 pr night pr person\\nFriend: camping spaces are nuts\nthey think I would pay as much as you need to pay for Airbnb for night\\nPersona: will look at it later\\nPersona: but dude\\nPersona: I will need a hella lot of almonds\\nPersona: I just realized how good homemade almond milk is\\nFriend: Wtf you talking about\\nFriend: How you milk them almonds\\nFriend: Can i have taste test\\nFriend: Should i remind you tonight or tomorrow?\nBecause shelters booked l fast\\nPersona: I blend them in water\\nPersona: No need for reminder, I have a timebox for it today \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: So you get crunchy water?\\nPersona: Nah, its smooth\\nPersona: its like milk\\nPersona: even has lather on top\\nPersona: fucking hell\\nFriend: Why you go saunagus without me man\\nPersona: Saunagus come to me mana\\nPersona: any thoughts about this?\\nFriend: More no than yes\n\nHave lectures and then exam some point in July\\nFriend: Maybe work before I go to bulgaria\\nFriend: 1 week into July ill be more sure of answer but i think econ will be hard so I'll need to postpone work\\nPersona: You want to go to black diamond library?\\nFriend: Today?

Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yeah that would be good\\nFriend: i just don\u2019t understand why it wouldn\u2019t shut down i jammed that turn off button\\nPersona: I would love to see that \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: its weird yeah\\nPersona: there is a startup for horses\\nFriend: uh\\nFriend: what\u2019s the idea\\nFriend: it\u2019s so smart making startup in equine sports bc people are rich and want to spent all their coins in their horses\\nPersona: is your app idea for rich people with horses also?\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: also the poor ones\\nFriend: but it might cater more to ambitious riders\\nFriend: which means their probably have money\\nPersona: okay next time lets talk about your billion dollar idea\\nFriend: yeahhh\\nPersona: We have this business idea for bite-sized finance goals. You get one goal every week to follow, which makes it easy and intuitive. NExt week is dfferent goal. Goals are curated by developers. Also the goals are personalized based on previous use. We may also intregreate receipt item data to even further personalize the goals. \n\nWhat kind of monetization techniques you would suggest?\\nPersona: Hey Vic\\nPersona: Can you do me a small favor?\\nPersona: Can you give me a few danish Tik Tok influencers, ideally 20 - 100K followers, no more\\nPersona: <3\\nPersona: Cause I have no clue, where to start finding them haha\\nFriend: yeah i\u2019ll be right on it haha\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: perfect for another task to do instead of studying\\nFriend: does it count if he is american but makes tik toks about denmark\\nFriend: and being danish\\nPersona: The audience needs to be in denmark/copenhagen\\nPersona: So if thats true, its good\\nPersona: Nicceee thanks\\nPersona: going through them now\\nPersona: those are really good\\nPersona: thank you vic\\nFriend: great! No problem you\u2019re welcome\\nPersona: whats the clotch selling app called?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: u want?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Im here\\nFriend: Thirsty but don't want to pee yet\\nPersona: now I am stuck in line xd\\nPersona: sure?\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: can you come outside?\\nFriend: Not with headphones\\nFriend: Oh\\nPersona: can you come by the door\\nPersona: we waiting\\nFriend: Ye we  om the wau\\nPersona: XP taste cola\\nPersona: fuck bro lets bbq sometime\\nFriend: Too wondy atm but good idea\\nPersona: Oh well\\nPersona: Then Vanced came\\nPersona: TwentyThree is like a very start-up minded scale-up\\nPersona: I just read the Masterstrategy plan fro 2023 - 2024\\nPersona: and holy shit it really feels like a rocket that's on t mission to the moon \ud83d\ude80\\nPersona: did you go to the date trip today?\\nFriend: Ai dont know the difference between scale up and startup \nHavent read yet\\nPersona: Scale up is a start-up that has grown a lot\\nPersona: A scaleup company or just scaleup is defined by the OECD as a company having an average annualized return of at least 20% in the past 3 years, and had at least 10 employees at the start of the 3 year period.\\nFriend: No! Her mom didnt reply to her for the car\nI knew i could ask you but didnt want to rush the day\nWe went to a park to slack line\n\nAnd then we talked and decided to go to my place for dinner \n\nWas good\\nFriend: Income you mean?\\nPersona: Just think of it as 3+ year company with 10+ employees, but not too big\\nPersona: okay, plan the trip some next time then\\nPersona: But sounds like a nice date\\nPersona: still\\nFriend: Yeah! Was good\nAlso there are more chances to go in the summer\nAnd it would be a shame not to fill the car with people when going\\nFriend: Think you might like goinf there\\nFriend: Could be fun to do it together with the sleep outside trip! Becsuse its south\\nPersona: Camping?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Apart from that of course me and my lithuanian friends call each other autistic all the time\\nPersona: it may have so merit though, cause we shitpost shit like this\\nFriend: wth\\nPersona: i dont think you have any. Maybe you say you are a bit anxious in social situations\\nPersona: but thats like super normal\\nPersona: I also am depending on the circumstances\\nFriend: yeah I guess but\\nPersona: pure autism\\nFriend: lol\\nPersona: like give me an situation in which you feel that you might be weird or autistic?\\nFriend: yeah socially I've been avoiding people and really anxious about social situations\n\nand when I've looked for contact, people have been weirded out\\nFriend: so the question is if I was poorly socialized so I did weird stuff or was just bit of autist\\nPersona: What did you do before you went to KEA first time?\\nPersona: I was also very anxious and avoided people when I used to play too much video games\\nPersona: I had this period in my middle school\\nPersona: If I felt the same way right now as an adult, I might feel like smth wrong or I am weird\\nFriend: There is the thing that autism is harder to detect in adults because when you grow you kind of learn to act normal\\nPersona: but what do you people when you look for contact, people are weirded out? Like these days, right now? Is it only about girls or including boys?\\nPersona: then so many of us may have autism and we are just pretending to act normal lol\\nPersona: Cause honestly, I do act a lot of stuff to reach my goals or make an impression to some person\\nPersona: Maybe I am also an autist then\\nPersona: I don't really know, I think I know too little about it.\\nPersona: for me the better understanding is the word 'weird'\\nFriend: yeah \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nthe thing that prompted me to be curious now is the 5 love languages\\nFriend: have you heard of that thing\\nPersona: is it like words, touch, and some 3 more?\\nFriend: yee ye!\\nFriend: but then there are these 5 others and I'm questioning if those 5 others are the ones for autists\\nFriend: or if normal people can also identify with them\\nPersona: 5 others.

Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries.

I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: is it like words, touch, and some 3 more?\\nFriend: yee ye!\\nFriend: but then there are these 5 others and I'm questioning if those 5 others are the ones for autists\\nFriend: or if normal people can also identify with them\\nPersona: 5 others. Like 5 love languages for autists?\\nFriend: ye :DD\\nFriend: you remember I keep asking to meet and just study together or do our thing but separately\\nFriend: the exact thing is stated as one of them\\nFriend: idk.. would have to test on people if they identify with any of these to see\\nPersona: But why?\\nPersona: Like what does it mean? does it mean that if you like that, you are autistic? I don't think it means that\\nPersona: let me see the rest\\nPersona: Umm but not everything is love, there is also friendship. Maybe if you did the parallel play/body doubling with a girl as a way to express love, maybe then it would fit.\\nFriend: eh.. I think you can express love language with friends, no?\\nPersona: okay maybe thats true, the love languages seem to be more general\\nPersona: the Neurodivergent Love Languages I quickly read through kinda seem fine and normal to me. Maybe world has started to appear more and more fake normal. Or maybe I am autistic xd\\nFriend: ye I'm not sure about you. Need to perform research on others\\nPersona: okay, this may be totally wrong, but maybe you don't act enough? Like when I got out of this no lifer stage of my life, I just kinda acted it out all the time and it then grew on me. Right now I am always trying to act the person that I want to be (a combination of multiple people from real life, TV, moviest, stories). I also sometimes consciously think about it. But in the end it works\\nPersona: If you think you are weird, then I am of the belief that socializing is a muscle and if you train it, it's impossible not to grow it. If there is autism involved, then idk how it works, but maybe its also solvable.\\nFriend: ye. It's not that autism is a drawback, but a different way of working\n\nbetter at one thing, worse at another\n\nso socializing is hard with normies\\nFriend: and yeah because socializing is like you say a muscle, harder to diagnose if you are autist and not normie\\nPersona: better at one thing worse at another is also not neccesarily autism. Lets say you are smart and inteligent, but less good at social. This can be because you just spent more time learning and thinking and less time for socializing.\\nPersona: Do you think that you tried socializing more and more and you didn't feel that you got better?\\nFriend: I definitely got better\nbut autism prolly is real \ni imagine like a predisposition to some stuff\\nFriend: but not necessarily strictly bad at it\\nPersona: its good then, maybe its just a matter of lack of socailization then.\\nPersona: I mean, healthcare is free, just get a test or something. When they say you don't have it, life may become so much easier. Just the confirmation from a doctor that smth is normal helped me so much a few times.\\nFriend: that's also what would be part of the finding if I find if I am autistic or not\n\nbecause it would prove if experiences play a role in it or is it a thing you just have/ have not\\nFriend: was acting like a bipolar person in covid summer because of stress\\nFriend: but I am not (usually) acting on emotion or like that\\nPersona: Did you suddenly get really worried about this or you been thinking about this what you are saying for a while now?\\nFriend: thinking a little \n\never since you said everyone is on the spectrum\\nPersona: Maybe my scale of 'normaliness' ir calibrated a little bit different, cause I view mood swings kinda normal. But idk to what extent you had them.\\nPersona: fuck I may have said that. If I said it then, I probably shounnt've because as you can see I am not really knowledgable about it when its real talk\\nFriend: :D yeah idk much about it either. Never researched"

Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options.

Work days pass so fast, I can't wait to go back.\n\nIn some ways it feels like I am running my own small startup there. I am fully in charge of the Website and partly of the tech stack surrounding it. I build the CMS and there are other people that use it - they are the users and CMS is my product. We all then collaborative build the website. Also, every single task is different and the variety of tasks is extreme. I am a part of the marketing department and I also work with most of other departments, sales, customer team, engineering team (for sparring, or when I use our own product for the website), design team, events. Maybe not the accounting/finance team, but that's fine. I also have extreme freedom in how I choose my tasks and prioritize them. Also, there are much less limits, compared to GROHE in what can be done.\\nPersona: Maybe its just because I worked 2.5 years at GROHE\\nPersona: the contrast is hard.

If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: this weekend has sucked all the life out of me i am so tired\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: oh dear\\nPersona: the weekend has barely started\\nPersona: well its halfway\\nFriend: we can meet tomorrow would that be good ok?\\nFriend: i will read up on the freaking framing analysis that is confusing me\\nFriend: and then we can do it together tomorrow?\\nPersona: Yeah lets do that\\nFriend: i feel like when we start writing it will take us max 4-5 hours in total\\nFriend: okkk\\nPersona: but I am not sure what you mean the change to framing analysis, so you gotta tell me about that\\nPersona: Cause the analysis that I am doing sort of sort of is starting to make sense\\nPersona: And for me its also pretty clear on what you have to do\\nPersona: In terms of determining their comms strategy\\nFriend: i think we need an analysis model to follow or whatever you call it\\nPersona: Okay go fly, we talk tommorow haha \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: I don't think we need that neccesserily, but yeah we talk tommorow or whenever you are rested and available\\nFriend: look at this tiny ass plane\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Fantastic \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019ll make a group chat soon!\\nPersona: Hey Liisa, I just remembered that from April 12, I will be hosting a friend at my place from a week.

Explain why if you think it might be removed by future you\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

Im not sure, depends how everyone are feeling etc\\nPersona: alrihht, I had signed up for Saunagus at 20:00 haha, so I think I will have to skip the sauna\\nPersona: cause if I go to sauna I would come only at around 22\\nFriend: Hmmm\\nFriend: Yeah think it would be bit late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Lynetteholm\\nPersona: can you get some utilization rates or complementary data from ur co?\\nFriend: Utilization of metro?\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: or bus\\nPersona: or thing u study\\nFriend: Ye we have passengers for ea day going years back\\nFriend: And time of day a d station\\nPersona: would you be able to use that 4 thesis?\\nFriend: I can ask if im allowed \nProbably not too secret\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: why is it not so simple to delete a cookie with js?\\nFriend: Set age to negative?\\nFriend: Idk\nIs it hard\\nPersona: but only of one key value pair\\nPersona: the cookie is a string\\nPersona: and contains 100 individual cookie key val pairs\\nPersona: I only need to delete one\\nFriend: The cookie is what\\nFriend: Bruh don't use cookie for storage\\nFriend: Just an identifier or something\\nFriend: Can you not remove one key from all\\nPersona: I need to delete this one cookie \"legalmonster-...-concent\" if its equal to {} cause there was a bug and if some browsers have this cookie as {} it causes problem\\nPersona: how do I remove a specific one cookie key value pair? Isn't all cookie stored in one string?\\nPersona: doing this is like rewriting the whole string which sucks\\nPersona: its a fucking string\\nPersona: Like I know I can do this by some string operations\\nPersona: but it sucks, like why isn't there a simple way to like remove one cookie entry from array\\nPersona: what I did here does not work as\\nFriend: No \nNot the whole thing\\nFriend: There are some good functions people already have to handle cookies\\nFriend: Oh man\nI wanna do some web stuff\\nFriend: If you hear about part time or freelance opportunity \nI want in\\nPersona: bruh I saw this\\nPersona: but wouldn't this\n    document.cookie = name + \"=\" +\n      ((path) ? \";path=\"+path:\"\")+\n      ((domain)?\";domain=\"+domain:\"\") +\n      \";expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT\";\n  }\nkill all other cookies?"

And I think capital in abstract terms is the relevant factor here.\\nPersona: Capital would be something that last more than a single generation. For example knowledge is capital.\\nPersona: And capital is actually another way of increasing fitness of species\\nPersona: So the two ways of increasing fitness 1) genetical mutation 2) capital\\nPersona: And homo sapiens has come to the point where fitness is grown faster using capital than genetical mutation\\nPersona: Genetical mutations take a lot of iterations, and when human life span is increasing (fitness), geneetical advancement is getting slower and slower\\nPersona: but capital advancement is super fast at this point\\nPersona: Genetical advancement is almost irrelevant now\\nPersona: Things like desire for sex, binge eating is the leftover residue\\nPersona: Which was effective back in the day, when capital was low\\nPersona: Thus reproduction as the meaning of life is very very sub-optimal since while atm reproduction is still essential, but it has extremely big diminishing returns. Compared to building capital which have been showing exponential effect latelt\\nPersona: Raising 10 kids instead of 2 will barelly have marginal added value these days\\nPersona: But inventing cures for diseases for example will increase our fitness\\nPersona: And the concept of 'life' or 'being alive', or even being made out of carbon may not even a fundamental thing.\\nPersona: The algorhythm of genetical mutations can have easy analogies in computer system now, thanks to the built up capital. Thus growth in fitness can happen even without the carbon based individuals.\\nPersona: This is what happends beyond technological singularity\\nPersona: Even at this point, when the number of carbon based individual decrease, optimization will continue to happen. The, what now is hard to label, but lets call it \"the state\" will continue to grow its chances of survival (fitness). And probably will eventually end up even in a different form than 'electricity based state'.\\nPersona: So its just a travelling impulse in the universe the changes its shape\\nPersona: Evolutionary mechanism is not even a fundamental part of it.\\nPersona: Evolutionary mechanism as a way to increase fitness did not go extint yet, but its now inferior to capital as a way to increase fitness\\nPersona: basically, idk where I am going with this\\nPersona: But we are basically apart of the 'carbon based state', at the point where capital is the superios way of increasing fitness. We could say we are in the transition to maybe 'electricity based state', where machines take over naturally.\\nPersona: dammn bro\\nPersona: wtf\\nPersona: Makes me feel so little\\nPersona: But lets add death\\nPersona: Im the early carbon based era, when genetical.advancement was superior, death could have been important because it allowed for natural selection. It was a filter for fit genomes. The only way to increase fitness was with compound reproduction, thus old generations were basically useless. Not only were they useless, but also anti-productive as in our carbon era, the carbon energy is limited and overpopulation makes is harder for new genomes to grow. Thus death of old genomes was optimal. Death as optimal.\\nPersona: these days however, while we are still carbon based, genetical growth is no longer the superior method. Thus this crosses out the statement about \"old generation are useless\", that held true before. Even if we are 10 gen behind and we live 1000 years, we can still build capital.\n\nLimited carbon energy is still a factor though, but its unknown whether the cost of extra carbon energy consumed by older individuals is more than added capital advancement from old individuals.\n\nBefore there was a typeof aging \"generational aging\", which is that your repoduction becomes more and more useless as more compound generations are born. This resulted in the natural development of 'biological aging', like I sad before as it was optimal.\\nPersona: But right now generational aging is insigfificant, thus the underlying reason of biological aging is gone.\\nPersona: Its possible though that its still.optimal because old brains tend to be less innovative, less explorative and thus contribute less to capital. Or even have negative effect on capital.\\nPersona: We no longer need reproduction for fitness growth, thus we may be able to have fitness growth without death as we can get rid of overpopulation by not reproducing (or reproducing at a rate = increase in carbon energy generation capacity)\\nPersona: But young people may however have higher contributions to capital though, due to neuroplasticity. So death may still be optimal.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1. Something you want to save up money to spend. The Shoes.\n2. Ways in which you can weekly save money. Don't order take-out today/this week.\\nPersona: So it can be quite confusing. But calling the 2nd a 'step' then sort of a forces to have some goal too. But if we can have some different naming...\\nPersona: we can also discus this tmmrow\\nFriend: Ok I\u2019ll think about it\\nFriend: can some of u remember what the more detailed background for \"indifferent\" means in this table\\nFriend: bc i am trying to describe the customers further using this and indifferent would not work bc it does not really tell anything so maybe its the same as not interested in PF?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

But if we can have some different naming...\\nPersona: we can also discus this tmmrow\\nFriend: Ok I\u2019ll think about it\\nFriend: can some of u remember what the more detailed background for \"indifferent\" means in this table\\nFriend: bc i am trying to describe the customers further using this and indifferent would not work bc it does not really tell anything so maybe its the same as not interested in PF?\\nFriend: I think we should have it be 2 scenarios that users can choose and change from at any given time. Not sure how well it works if they run at the same time \n\n1. original idea \n2. your idea\n\nHowever, I think there should only be 2 elements to it because otherwise it becomes inconsistent imo\n\nSo Goal > daily nudges \n\nName idea for daily nudges could be \u201ddaily-dos\u201c\\nFriend: Yeah I think indifferent means they just don\u2019t care\\nFriend: Or yes-ification instead of notification\\nPersona: It sounds like the same\\nPersona: yesification xdddd\\nPersona: what is original idea and your idea?\\nFriend: This is yours\\nPersona: I think daily nudges is fine. Cause some ways to save mainly consists of don't. So daily-do's would limit the kind of nudges we can have.\\nPersona: Whats the original?\\nPersona: Without the goal?\\nFriend: The initial think we talked about today. Where you can choose a weekly goal based on the multi-select question\\nFriend: But then we have to decide if we want that to be a circle that reoccurs every week or how\\nPersona: The 'change of scenarios' then should not be like a switch-button. If you don't set \"adidas shoes' goal', Then you are in scenario \"Original idea\". If you do set 'adidas shoes' goal, then you are in \"Your idea\" scenario. What do you think about that?\\nFriend: so then i feel like being lazy and not into personla finance are kin dof in the same space as well bc they would take up a lot of people then.... I would make more sense to write that people are lazy and not into doing their personal finances rather than they dont care abt right? or am i fishing\\nPersona: But the reason I am saying 'adidas shoes' goal is because there is a disambiguity between the two types of goals we are talking about. This is what I mean that we need to invest different words for that.\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: Hmm ok so different names of the goals\\nFriend: But daily nudges doesn\u2019t sound that great either\\nPersona: I think lazy and not into personal finance are different things.\\nPersona: I think their are related\\nFriend: Maybe the weekly ones could be targets and the specific ones you set yourself could be goals\\nFriend: Like it\u2019s my target to spend less on beer and my goal to afford Adidas\\nPersona: @Victoria I am still thinking about this lazy vs not interested\\nFriend: i think u are right its not the same\\nFriend: im just going to say \"not into doing their personal finances\"\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Didn't have pgone today\\nFriend: Forgot it home\\nPersona: oh so nathalie going too\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: now we will have proper game dev\\nPersona: damn, and you managed to take the challenge without it?\\nPersona: must have been super productive\\nFriend: Yeah but also no headphones to isolate from noise\\nFriend: But did do a bunch\\nPersona: how tf you forgot both?\\nPersona: you were like biking and never wondered why tf there is no music hm hmm hmmmmmm\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Had public transport\nHard to turn the bus around\\nFriend: And i was getting late for work\\nPersona: xdd oh\\nPersona: alright\\nPersona: nice though, I would not dare\\nPersona: maybe for a challenge\\nPersona: How is it going with nathalie though?

I used to put 10% of income there, but not thats filled up I have them free to put somewhere else\\nPersona: I currently distribute 10% for financial/investment saving\\nFriend: so instead of safety jar --> financial investments?\\nFriend: the mentor at cbs recommended for us to build a \"fuck off\" jar :DD\nexactly a savings one\n\nthat would allow you to say \"no\" to your boss when you get asked something you dont want to do (for moral or whatever reasons)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I need this tatoo\\nFriend: This is discomforting\\nPersona: you know Yea Theory?\\nFriend: Say yes to everything?\\nPersona: No no, its a youtube channel\\nFriend: No\nIll check it\\nPersona: there is too much to check\\nPersona: they have grown huge\\nPersona: but they inspired me a lot during my 17-19s\\nPersona: maybe this tatoo has enough meaning to get a lifetime parking permit on my skin\\nPersona: Did you know you can copy code from VS code to MindManager with formating. By default formatting gets removed, but if you first paste to Word and then copy from Word and paste into MManager you keep the formating.\\nPersona: I been doing this for a while\\nPersona: and my Flutter mindmap looks sexy af\\nFriend: I've seen it works VSCode->google sheets\nDIdn't know about mind manager\\nFriend: How do you make the lines not get fucked up?\nWord->VSC\\nPersona: you go inside cell and you paste inside cell\\nPersona: I let his wife drive car xdd\\nPersona: she has license\\nPersona: but prob fake cause holy shit, I am glad I am alive\\nFriend: Wtf happened mab\\nFriend: Man\\nPersona: nothing\\nPersona: but she can barely shift gears xdd\\nPersona: his boyfriend is even worses lol\\nPersona: He does not have license\\nPersona: I risked so much giving them to drive\\nPersona: He his bordiur like 2 times\\nFriend: Bordiur \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I NEED THIS\\nPersona: this will be my life purchase\\nFriend: what is that XDDD\\nPersona: big lava lamp\\nFriend: i saw\nits just crazy big\\nFriend: Hey!

So when we were at the Sciecne and Coctails Kristina message me that she applied as soon as applications opened, and it was lagging cause many were applying. And I totally forgot about it, so I got stressed that good ones are taken.\\nPersona: But omg I am not late at all.\\nPersona: Some are taken\\nPersona: but they took only the ridiculously boring ones\\nPersona: like\\nPersona: \"Scandinavian Sustainability & Corporate Social Responsibility\"\\nPersona: I would never pick this one wtf\\nPersona: \"Introduction to Sustainable Business\"\\nPersona: eww\\nPersona: \"Corporate Strategy\" this one is not bad but sounds boring af\\nPersona: or this \"International Business and Sustainable Development\"\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\\nPersona: nice actually\\nPersona: cant risk watching\\nPersona: already spent an hour watching a drama video about my ex best friend xdd\\nPersona: I had this crazy best friend back in Lithuania highsschool days\\nPersona: he was an insanely bold man and then together we did incredible stuff, we got on a news a couple of times\\nPersona: crazy dude, he now got into this tv show and mingled with some drama people\\nPersona: sometimes I wish to go to that mode where I live a life of crazy, bold ideas\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: deall\\nPersona: You started a video chat.\\nPersona: You joined the video chat.\\nFriend: Karla joined the video chat.\\nFriend: Lucas joined the video chat.\\nFriend: finished a meeting now, on my way home\\nFriend: what have i misses\\nFriend: missed*\\nPersona: he most common is net income divided by the total cost of the investment, or ROI = Net income / Cost of investment x 100. As an example, take a person who invested $90 into a business venture and spent an additional $10 researching the venture.\\nFriend: We just went through the slides, discussing calculations and questions the judges might ask us, in terms of what we need to research, specifically concerning how big the market potential actually is in numbers.\\nPersona: command crocodile does not work on my mac \ud83d\ude2d\\nFriend: noo I\u2019ll show you on saturday\\nPersona: yess please do hah\\nPersona: We are calling at 15:00?\\nFriend: I am not able to attend, sorry \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: I am a bit stuck with my group.

Like 5 love languages for autists?\\nFriend: ye :DD\\nFriend: you remember I keep asking to meet and just study together or do our thing but separately\\nFriend: the exact thing is stated as one of them\\nFriend: idk.. would have to test on people if they identify with any of these to see\\nPersona: But why?\\nPersona: Like what does it mean? does it mean that if you like that, you are autistic? I don't think it means that\\nPersona: let me see the rest\\nPersona: Umm but not everything is love, there is also friendship. Maybe if you did the parallel play/body doubling with a girl as a way to express love, maybe then it would fit.\\nFriend: eh.. I think you can express love language with friends, no?\\nPersona: okay maybe thats true, the love languages seem to be more general\\nPersona: the Neurodivergent Love Languages I quickly read through kinda seem fine and normal to me. Maybe world has started to appear more and more fake normal. Or maybe I am autistic xd\\nFriend: ye I'm not sure about you. Need to perform research on others\\nPersona: okay, this may be totally wrong, but maybe you don't act enough? Like when I got out of this no lifer stage of my life, I just kinda acted it out all the time and it then grew on me. Right now I am always trying to act the person that I want to be (a combination of multiple people from real life, TV, moviest, stories). I also sometimes consciously think about it. But in the end it works\\nPersona: If you think you are weird, then I am of the belief that socializing is a muscle and if you train it, it's impossible not to grow it. If there is autism involved, then idk how it works, but maybe its also solvable.\\nFriend: ye. It's not that autism is a drawback, but a different way of working\n\nbetter at one thing, worse at another\n\nso socializing is hard with normies\\nFriend: and yeah because socializing is like you say a muscle, harder to diagnose if you are autist and not normie\\nPersona: better at one thing worse at another is also not neccesarily autism. Lets say you are smart and inteligent, but less good at social. This can be because you just spent more time learning and thinking and less time for socializing.\\nPersona: Do you think that you tried socializing more and more and you didn't feel that you got better?\\nFriend: I definitely got better\nbut autism prolly is real \ni imagine like a predisposition to some stuff\\nFriend: but not necessarily strictly bad at it\\nPersona: its good then, maybe its just a matter of lack of socailization then.\\nPersona: I mean, healthcare is free, just get a test or something. When they say you don't have it, life may become so much easier. Just the confirmation from a doctor that smth is normal helped me so much a few times.\\nFriend: that's also what would be part of the finding if I find if I am autistic or not\n\nbecause it would prove if experiences play a role in it or is it a thing you just have/ have not\\nFriend: was acting like a bipolar person in covid summer because of stress\\nFriend: but I am not (usually) acting on emotion or like that\\nPersona: Did you suddenly get really worried about this or you been thinking about this what you are saying for a while now?\\nFriend: thinking a little \n\never since you said everyone is on the spectrum\\nPersona: Maybe my scale of 'normaliness' ir calibrated a little bit different, cause I view mood swings kinda normal. But idk to what extent you had them.\\nPersona: fuck I may have said that. If I said it then, I probably shounnt've because as you can see I am not really knowledgable about it when its real talk\\nFriend: :D yeah idk much about it either. Never researched\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: alright just call me\\nFriend: or let me know when\\nFriend: hahah yeah\\nFriend: best procrastination\\nFriend: you should download tiktok that shit can fill out a whole day\\nPersona: but its so good. It beats life purpose. If not peer pressure I would just settle for tik toks for life\\nPersona: I had extreme fun today watching a reel where a guy eats a huge whole cabbage in a library\\nFriend: hahah it\u2019s so true\\nFriend: also tik tok gives me like most of my day to day information and knowledge\\nFriend: even buying new shit i just go to tik tok to ask if it\u2019s good\\nFriend: the guy with the cabbage reminds me so much of my colleague from Brussels that I shared a desk with\u2026 he drive me crazy\\nPersona: what did he eat ahahaha?\\nFriend: sometimes i think he did it to annoy me\\nFriend: bananas\\nFriend: like 3 a day minimum\\nFriend: freaking soup\\nPersona: :DDd\\nFriend: no spoon all slurping from the cup\\nPersona: :DDDDDD\\nFriend: wonderful time\\nFriend: really enjoyed the company\\nPersona: Hey, what do you think about meeting up on the weekend and studying for corporate finance?\\nPersona: Would weekend work for you?\\nFriend: that would be nice\\nFriend: let me just figure it out\\nFriend: friday i am going to stay at school for a few hours after class and do CF\\nFriend: weekend is a little unsure for me until tomorrow bc i don\u2019t know if i can going to competition\\nPersona: both days?\\nFriend: So, tomorrow i will go to school at 10 and study until class\\nFriend: then friday I will study after class\\nPersona: So only friday works for you right?\\nPersona: after class\\nFriend: saturday or sunday might but idk\\nPersona: So maybe lets do Friday after class\\nPersona: I booked a room on friday\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Ahh I didnt know that you wanted to go so early\\nPersona: Shit its kinda awkward to go alone\\nPersona: Can I bring someone that you havent signed up, given that ur colleague is staff?\\nPersona: Or is Laura coming too with some friend of hers?\\nFriend: Maybe! Can check\\nFriend: Laura said she will go to her friends place instead\\nFriend: She was going to join us otherwise\\nFriend: What time you'd like to be there? I'll talk with my colleague\\nPersona: hmm, maybe I can get your colleagues contact?\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: She is unresponsive\nShe prolly is working already\\nFriend: You could use my name on the list if they have guard or Lauras\\nFriend: Names on list\nPetyo Zhechev\nAiridas Brikas\nLaura Munk\nAlberte Golgert\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: Okay I will see\\nFriend: Hey!

(look up \"cloze\" cards)\\nPersona: Anki is super powerful\\nPersona: you can even learn from images, by image occlusion cards\\nFriend: Yeah, I\u2019m using spaced repetition and flashcard type of stuff for other subjects. Just never used anki\\nFriend: But its a smart thing to do\\nPersona: Anki is very well made and has huge community.

Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: this weekend has sucked all the life out of me i am so tired\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: oh dear\\nPersona: the weekend has barely started\\nPersona: well its halfway\\nFriend: we can meet tomorrow would that be good ok?\\nFriend: i will read up on the freaking framing analysis that is confusing me\\nFriend: and then we can do it together tomorrow?\\nPersona: Yeah lets do that\\nFriend: i feel like when we start writing it will take us max 4-5 hours in total\\nFriend: okkk\\nPersona: but I am not sure what you mean the change to framing analysis, so you gotta tell me about that\\nPersona: Cause the analysis that I am doing sort of sort of is starting to make sense\\nPersona: And for me its also pretty clear on what you have to do\\nPersona: In terms of determining their comms strategy\\nFriend: i think we need an analysis model to follow or whatever you call it\\nPersona: Okay go fly, we talk tommorow haha \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: I don't think we need that neccesserily, but yeah we talk tommorow or whenever you are rested and available\\nFriend: look at this tiny ass plane\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Erkan late 15 20 min he says\\nPersona: whata ur plan?\\nPersona: Whats*\\nFriend: Im chilling at work 2 stops away from there\nIll grab a durum or sometething from netto to eat at dr byen anyways\\nFriend: If you wanna join im free from now\nElse we can meet later too\\nPersona: Hm.

If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Idk how it works exatcly, but seeing real-life in color and also seeing virtual UI is pretty cool.\\nPersona: I have a VR headset that can do similar, just when you look at real life through it, its black and white.\\nPersona: And I can watch youtube through it like in this video\\nPersona: When I first experienced it I thought its super cool. Like future\\nPersona: But I never watch youtube like that so far, because the bulky headset is just kind of uncomfortable and its difficult to snack or drink while doing it. Also the android in Oculus is quite primitive and feels like a phone. I cant quickly switch around apps, multi-task. If Meta could fix that I would use it\\nPersona: I think TV's and computer screens could be replaced by vr easily. The headsets just needs to be much more comfortable, higher res and baterry should last longer.\\nPersona: have you tried vr?\\nPersona: hehe\\nFriend: oh cool\\nFriend: yeah i have tried it but only for games not for \u201creal life\u201d UI\\nFriend: it\u2019s cool\\nFriend: i just see people coming home and then going into their own bubble with this shit on for hours\\nFriend: but they should make them less ugly and big\\nPersona: same moslt\\nPersona: mostly*\\nPersona: the one you sent is pretty nice\\nPersona: how was the competition btw?\\nFriend: really good it went super well\\nFriend: thanks for asking\\nPersona: nice \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc34\\nFriend: would you know how to make a dating app\\nFriend: tinder style\\nPersona: If I wanted I could learn to make any app\\nPersona: whats your idea?\\nFriend: do youu think i can learn it too?\\nFriend: i just had an idea to make a tinder style app for riders and horses bc we talked abt how shit all the sales sites are\\nFriend: we pay 100euros for a 6 month post of a horse\\nFriend: and the provider of the website dont do shit and the sites are so outdated\\nPersona: and is the market for that big?
