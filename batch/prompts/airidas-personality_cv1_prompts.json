Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time.

Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

My domination reached new peaks again.\nPersona: I'm ready to be tested\nPersona: So think a chicken, cow or pig should allso work. But whats the next step exatcly after getting them drunk?\nPersona: I saw once on youtube a guy made moonshine out of toilet paper\nFriend: oh look, that Soplica experience has made you very violent apparently\nFriend: we need a control condition to assess that. we have to sample your Soplica-free prediction before the next lottery\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: You can't drink in Lithuania until 20yo?\nFriend: Sounds perfect\nFriend: Lol\nFriend: Vodka pong\nFriend: No worries\nFriend: I just know and trust myself that if not for being drunk I wouldn't have done that\nFriend: After that everything went downhill, I made a wrong decision and yeah\nFriend: I'm really not proud of this situation hah\nFriend: At that time I had a \"killer shot\".

I didn't pass out or anything, just got more stupid xd\nPersona: thats trueee\nPersona: I am just justyfying myself lol\nFriend: Possibly yes. But personally I've had situations when I opened up too much/made wrong decisions\nPersona: not drinking is definetely good decision\nPersona: fuck sorry for the peer pressure\nPersona: okay okay xdd\nPersona: fair enough\nPersona: or with a cozy close friend party, some wine really opens up some honest conversations\nPersona: I dont think its a matter or preparation, for example, when I am out clubing or at a party, drinking can make it much easier to enjoy it, lose the judgement\nFriend: From everything that you can imagine, I promise you that it was something else\nFriend: Nothing interesting to hear xd\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree. Drinking is a weakness\nPersona: aaaa I want to heard that \ud83e\udd7a\nPersona: health xdd\nFriend: And at the end, I don't need it at all.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree. Drinking is a weakness\nPersona: aaaa I want to heard that \ud83e\udd7a\nPersona: health xdd\nFriend: And at the end, I don't need it at all. Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of.

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.

Instead of a pre-party drink, we will get your mood up with some pre-party challenge\nFriend: Fuck me I am overwhelmed of this rejection fear, shit when we are going on a trip?\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\nFriend: please do\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nope, I'm at work. what have I missed?\nPersona: Ups. Ok deal, you caught me. Dont tell anybody\nPersona: did you get to see the free firework show in our football field? \ud83e\udd23 lol\nFriend: let's strike a deal. you've already told me about the fight club, which is against the rules and you should to be forced to expel yourself. I'm not going to tell anybody that you spilled the beans. you're going to forget about the sin fiasco\nPersona: I am afraid I cant talk about this \ud83d\ude36\nPersona: I will !!! Unless you give me a refund anddd a compensation for moral damage!\nPersona: I dont know, it must be some curse, cause he is also annoyed when I chew next to him, but only next to me.\nFriend: wait a minute. didn't you say that you had people sword fighting in your kitchen? I'm afraid that your fight club days aren't over at all\nFriend: hahah, okay. maybe that was an overstatement, but I did think you did something equally awful to your jaw to reenact that scene\nFriend: well, tough luck. you have no power here. go, write a negative review\nFriend: oh shoot, you actually did\nFriend: but...why specifically him? \ud83d\ude05\nPersona: Umm, they were standing next to, just in case stuff got outta hand. Plus we agreed on some respectable rules. It was a relatively civil fight.\nPersona: xddd really?\nPersona: I demand to speak to the manager!!!\nPersona: waaaaait, but I paid for a sin related torture cycle.\nPersona: Hm I never complained about chewing sound through the microphone specificly. But we mutually and also exclusively hate each other with my brother when we chew, so I get that. Him chewing could def. be my turture cycle. But only him, others dont annoy me\nFriend: yup, this is pretty silly, I'll give you that. but I don't know what kind of parties you go to if there really wasn't even one person responsible enough to stop that madness\nFriend: not gonna lie, after that sentence I straight up thought you shot yourself in the jaw\nFriend: you said yourself that they're not supposed to be, so I'm just following your rules \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: yes, but also - you know when somebody is mic'd and while they speak, it just sounds very...moist? yeah, that\nPersona: gopnik* (idk why my brain decided to capitalize that)\nPersona: That made me much more confident it the Gopnik filled streets of some parts of Lithuania haha\nPersona: So at one of the parties, I challenged one of my friend's friend to full force fist fight, just because of fight club influence. It was a mutual agreement, much like with the rules in fight club. I got the adrenaline that I needed. I also taken a pretty good hit to the jaw, so I couldn't normally chew for a week after. I am of opinion it was worth it.\nPersona: I may have taken this film too literally when I was young, because I decided that I actually needed to get into a fight. I did some karate kumite before, but the fighting there was very controlled and you didn't use full force cause if you knowout the opponent you actually lose in kumite. I wanted smth that felt more real\nPersona: I am sorry, but no building were hurt. Just my jaw\nPersona: And whats the sin associated with it?\nPersona: Is it like chewing sounds? Like especially when chewing without keeping the mouth shut?\nFriend: funnily enough, I've never watched the whole movie. maybe 60% or something, and turned it off. but later found a book and absolutely loved it\nFriend: alright, what have I just bought? if you did anything short of blowing up a building I'm going to be deeply disappointed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nFriend: this is how much money has passed through my hands (not remained in me)\nbecause of trading xD\nFriend: or we can just have 3 calculations for total cost. And then have 3 profits for each cost\nso you get a range\nFriend: can choose if you want to use the bid, ask or \"price' not sure what price is from the ePrices sheet\nPersona: you need to outgrow everyone then\nPersona: xddddd\nFriend: or maybe it will yield me money. 1ncc per 100 traded \n\nrisk is too high to get profit but would be funny\nFriend: pick a good that has a steady supply/demand (thus price)\n\nfix the price like those 2 did\n\nso I will put super many buy and sell orders myself \n\nand keep it at that position for as long as I can until I go broke\nFriend: I want to get a monopoly on a good\nFriend: i have an idea. I want to try it when I get rich\nFriend: buy high sell low!\nFriend: lose only 1 ncc per 100 traded\nFriend: nice :D\nFriend: what a perfect plan\n\nI'm donig it!\nFriend: i lose almost nothing and I get those fckers off of the market\nFriend: maybe I can just buy all the goods from one and sell to the other\nPersona: if I was sybil I would just sell\nPersona: lol this is insane\nFriend: the minimum spread possible\nFriend: I've been playing with spread a lot :D \nit leads to people doing this\nPersona: I make my sales in Moria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: oh man, I'm not much of a cook. I don't even use my own kitchen\nFriend: well, keep your fingers crossed that we find something then, or it'll be a very anticlimactic read\nFriend: forgive my ignorance, but actually what's the advantage for the user in that choice?\nFriend: so you remain in your hyped up clueless state until suddenly two weeks later it suddenly clicks while you're making a sandwich or something\nFriend: quite an interesting experience for sure. you don't really know what is happening half of the time, but it sounds exciting anyway\nPersona: and also, do you also want to cook smth tomorrow, or should I grab some semi-fancy oven dish?\nPersona: Eyy, what an cool topic. Would definitely want to read it when you finish it\nPersona: Even Google is calling code red, because people started to use AI chatbots for 'googling' instead of Google.\nPersona: It's crazy, OpenAI build a neural network that beat the best Dota 2 team. Now with ChatGPT it exploded to mainstream levels\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting.\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\nFriend: but not that\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\nFriend: haha no worries\nFriend: yes sir\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: one trip to town and I'll show you \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: All right, maybe we will be able try some of them before next party, maybe before Luiza's Party \ud83d\ude01\nPersona: if you need help on trying that let me know, I can kick you into some challenges\nFriend: Oh yes it is a great books, it really helps a lot :D but your way of self destruction by embarasment prolly helped even more, It was a great idea, I have to try it out one day\nPersona: so good\nPersona: Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence ppl is my top 1 book\nFriend: For example?\nFriend: It's real life lesson\nPersona: I can think of some things in my life I learnt through self-destruction\nFriend: That's true\nPersona: and it does work\nPersona: its just takes balls and iron will\nPersona: improvemnt through self-destruction also sounds convincing\nPersona: or maybe not, cause its time for change xd\nPersona: you got to tell me that :D\nPersona: right now I am a bit busy but I am still curiuos what kind of self improvement you do? books, sports, what kind of videos\nFriend: It's time for change\nPersona: Its scary tho\nPersona: I was also thinkint about that\nPersona: yee you get the idea right\nPersona: The self-destruction part then start to make a lot of sense\nPersona: Read this\nPersona: I never thought seriously what it meant until now\nPersona: I was just about to message you about that quote\nPersona: holy shit man, are you spying on me or what? xxd\nFriend: Is in my mind\nFriend: Self improvement is like masturbation\nFriend: It was so fun\nFriend: Yess\nPersona: Hey man, have you watched film club already?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Dude this game\nFriend: always wanted to gain\nFriend: I don't wanna lose\ngoing to look like a skeleton even more :D\nPersona: do you want to lose weight or gain.\nFriend: I can be but my body doesn't want xD I had to put effort\nPersona: wqit\nPersona: your can be more\nPersona: I m 65. and your taller\nFriend: it's 65-66 always\nFriend: usually I can't pass 66.6\nFriend: think I should be careful tho\nwill go over 75 at this rate easily\nPersona: How much before?\nFriend: I'm almost doing a good job\n\njust measured myself\n\nI'm almost 69 kg! \none small win :D\nPersona: like pictures\nPersona: get reminders with ur dreams or smth\nFriend: I'll play a game of beat saber to get the blood flowing\nFriend: I want to go sleep now\nFriend: o\nFriend: reminders don't work\n\nI know I have to do stuff :D i just choose not t\nPersona: like they remind you stuff if you gotta get back on track\nPersona: Get some reminders\nPersona: nice\nFriend: so today I'm a good boy\n\nwent to lectures\n\nate\n\nnow I'm gonna study :D\nPersona: xddd\nFriend: checked it again yesterday and I'm like \"damn.. gotta get back on track\"\nFriend: sheet is productive but \nI haven't been productive\nPersona: How is your sheet productivity tool working?\nPersona: true\nFriend: maybe it's not a bad idea\n\nwater is primarily used for agriculture\nso would be a good place to sell\non the local market\nFriend: but maybe a bad idea because agriculture bonuses on this planet are beast\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 3/10\nPersona: No, I am 3\nFriend: :D ok\nPersona: in this way\nPersona: if you want to say 2, say 1 or 3 , skip the two\nPersona: no you just dont say 2\nFriend: two 3?\nso like 6\nPersona: from 1 to 10, I am like 2 - 3\nFriend: we have to skip it and start from 3\nFriend: no because 2 is cursed :D\nPersona: you are really confusing with scales xdd\nPersona: can I do from 1 to 10?\nFriend: 10\nPersona: which is most sick 3 or 10?\nFriend: on the scale of 3 to 10\nFriend: how sick do you feel\nFriend: if you make IC NC, you'll be golden\nFriend: oof\nPersona: Plus idk, I am having a cold xd\nPersona: 14*\nPersona: I have an arrangement at 15\nFriend: wanna play tomorrow?

With the automated brokers I assume they'll just sell your position (or buy it) so they don't go on minus\nFriend: also metals grew (and keep growing) \nevery time there is instability my father said, gold prices grow\n\ncause currencies might fail and people want something secure\nPersona: Can you lose more than you have with CFD's? (like with short selling)\nFriend: if you believe something will be growing. Like we are learning about green energy\n\nit might be worth looking into it\nFriend: so I wouldn't fuck with cfds or if I do I'll make sure I have enough money to cover for it if it goes down (so I don't default)\nPersona: But then again it seems that \"everything is luck based\".\nFriend: yeah. But you shouldn't use high leverage (unless you are sure it won't move in your direction)\nPersona: Oh yeah, the point of CFD is that you need less capital to make money. Do I understand this correctly?\nFriend: I want to bide my time. Wait for the next crisis and not buy too much so I don't have to lose\n\njust wait it out and voila\nFriend: I checked and hope that this crisis is the same like the others. Prices and stocks come to a normal level\n\nThe time i entered in the pandemic wasn't the lowest low, and that's why when prices kept falling I had to resell and buy other stuff\n\nand I didn't feel like buying what I can with my money was enough. I wanted to buy more (cause cfd allows you to use the margin)\nPersona: Like you did, but maybe not with 100k :D\nPersona: Thats why stock market never attracted me.  But I want to try stock market just to experiment\nPersona: I fear this is the truth\nFriend: and I became even more convinced after the shit I did\n\nbecause you can never know, unless you have inside information. Everything else is luck based\nPersona: I think what you learned is much more than that :D\nFriend: diversification also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: do we meet up\n\nIt's only 1 o clock\nFriend: wtf xD for real?

He put so much money on MCG buy\n2800 at 19\nFriend: oversupply on myy market too\n\nand this dude Universal Reserve\n\nyou will see him being talked about from others\n\nhe is far ahead with trading\nPersona: The one I produce\nPersona: The one I trade\nPersona: MCG\nFriend: what comodity)\nFriend: the fuck is happening\nwhat good\nPersona: Market crash\nPersona: I should do that too\nPersona: lol\nPersona: xddddddd\nFriend: my equity hasn't increased much so maybe I'm losing\n\nbut it can't be..\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Just decided to take it as a self development/discipline  practice\nFriend: I have nothing against drinking, been to many parties where my firends had alcohol/other stuff\nFriend: Well yeah, often people say that they drink to be able to do X (break the ice, be more confident, make decisions). But if you wouldn't be able/are not prepared to do that while sober than why should it be done when drunk?\nPersona: Thats why I never drank alone or out of sadness etc.\nPersona: I also drink mostly because I want to break the ice\nPersona: I totally agree.

Most people drink to gain confidence, relax etc.\nYou've seen me in CPH xd don't need any help with that\nFriend: I also workout few days a week at the gym so it's not healthy to drink even the night before that\nFriend: I made a wrong decision while being drunk and sth clicked in my brain not to drink hah\nFriend: 1. Health\n2. My own philosophy/morality\nPersona: What made you quit drinking?\nFriend: Not even a beer\nFriend: No :<\nPersona: but you will not drink with me? \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: By showing you the vodka bar?\nPersona: Friday nigght \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nPersona: lol \"beeta\". I cant type\nPersona: how?\nFriend: But no worries, I support your love for vodka\nFriend: Yeah\nPersona: really?\nFriend: Now I don't drink anyways\nPersona: Oh biking drunk is the best\nPersona: but 2 beeta is definetely okau\nFriend: I allow myself to go on a bike xd that's fun when you're drunk\nPersona: I dont remember for sure\nPersona: in denmark its 0.4 or 0.5\nFriend: Nor sail\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\u2019s still a good point maybe we can incorporate it somewhere\nFriend: so you are not using the initial decrease in welfare?\nPersona: Although I think I can\nPersona: But for the decrease in conflict, I am not 100% sure yet, i am still making sense of the new data\nFriend: @Marcus Lind Jeppesen did my mom say that this challenge made knowldge sharing harder bc they went away from physical meetings?\nFriend: However I think now that we aren\u2019t using creativity anymore we aren\u2019t making that point anymore either\nFriend: Main*\nFriend: I think overall there are more opportunities for DE, thinking back to @Airidas Brikas and my section the Mann challenge would be an initial decrease in employee welfare and satisfaction, due to alienation\nFriend: great\nPersona: I cant give challenges, but I can give two opportunities that it presented: Increase cohesion and decrease conflict in a culturally diverse and disperse team.\nFriend: For me the main challenge (acording to ba) was the move away from face-to-face interactions\nFriend: if you guys were to summerize the challnges that covid 19 presented in digital europe what would that be\nPersona: We dediced to cut the analysis and leave the theory part longer. So you don't need to cut the theory\nFriend: The call ended.\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\nPersona: You joined the call.\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\nFriend: Marcus started a call.\nPersona: should we call?\nPersona: did you send an email? or where are the answers?\nFriend: idk how we use this as i source bc i basically talked to her and she answered as i wrote down her points\nFriend: here are the answers\nFriend: guys i got my moms attention for a sec\nFriend: I think call first and then finish\nFriend: Let us know how far along you are at 12 and then we'll figure it out\nFriend: guys i am not done with my analysis part but i will try to be at 12\ud83e\udee3 sorry abt being slow. Would you rather that i finish is before joining the call and then being late to the call (if i am fast maybe like 30-50 minutes late) or that i join the call and finish after?\nPersona: 12 is good for me too\nFriend: 12 or 13 would be best for me\nFriend: for me the later the better\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nobody even doubts\nPersona: of course ita loss making\nPersona: its a physical stofr\nPersona: gamestop is a meme\nFriend: theyve been performing worse and worse each year\nFriend: and game stop has no brighter future than green energy\nFriend: at 250 usd gme makes 0.6 divident yield\nFriend: good future for the company\n1% yield\nFriend: Orested\nFriend: ok\nlet me show you something\nPersona: i would buy tho\nPersona: maybe\nPersona: but they cant anymore cuz most populat  investment middle mens blocked buying\nFriend: now is the time to short\nFriend: everyone jumped on the buy train because of shorters\nPersona: cuz Reddit bought so much of them\nPersona: you cant even quit stocks at this point\nPersona: its too risky witg such volatility\nPersona: no\nPersona: ni\nPersona: ni\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: i knew i shouldda shorted :D\nPersona: its a violotion\nFriend: it already crashed to 150\nFriend: look\nFriend: bro\nPersona: that let buy/sell stocks\nPersona: and other apps\nPersona: cuz robinhood is corrupt\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: gonna watch a film\nPersona: a day of relaxation\nPersona: today is a good day\nPersona: idk if it will work\nPersona: my and tobys approach is super diffefent\nPersona: I changed my approaxh\nPersona: but then\nPersona: i did yeah\nPersona: add*\nFriend: whaaat \nwhy not?\n\nyou said it yourself its about quantity of what youve done and not quality of writing\nPersona: nothing excitinf about it.

This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\nPersona: omg JS is god\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\nPersona: shit man I am happy. I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\nPersona: gone back to basics\nPersona: this is too mentally heavy\nPersona: omg my head is exploding\nPersona: But economist use reverse - now this confuses me a lot when making thid\nPersona: as p in the independent - horizontas\nPersona: You usually plot Q as the y, and P as x\nPersona: When you have Q(P) = ...\nPersona: See how Price is the y and Quantity is the x\nPersona: omg I just remembered that economicsts use a reverse axis\nPersona: So I think for now I can use y=ax+b for individual demands and joining them will give me a curve anyways :D\nPersona: I made this demos a year ago I think, found it in my mmmap\nFriend: yeah\nFriend: starting to curve\nPersona: of total demand\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I dreamed to be a ninja as a child\nPersona: in what way?\nFriend: are you into spy stuff\nPersona: honestly for its its too muc hstruggle\nPersona: xd\nFriend: ye\njust did\n\nused google for 2 of the achievements\nPersona: have you completed it?\nPersona: omg this game is hillarious?\nFriend: quite the meme persona\nFriend: tyler1 is a league streamer\nFriend: looking for the signs\n\norigins of xd's and people that use it\nPersona: ah cool\nPersona: wat? :D\nFriend: hehe xd\nFriend: not sure if you can zoom properly\nFriend: grabbed breakfast and im ready\nFriend: break until 1010 i  think\nFriend: ye\nPersona: do you know where is lesson?\nFriend: nice\nPersona: :D\nPersona: Read some reviews on steam.
