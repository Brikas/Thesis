Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\nPersona: Sounds gr8!

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\nFriend: So will skip him\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\nFriend: for all\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Hiiii\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Hello!!

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: love*\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\nPersona: Sounds gr8!

She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nFriend: we can investigate if u have time\nPersona: Cool.

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.
