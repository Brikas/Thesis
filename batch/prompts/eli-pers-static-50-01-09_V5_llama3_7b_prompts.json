I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them.

Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them.

Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me).

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them.

Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s noon or midnight\u2026\\nPersona: That\u2019s an accurate description!\ud83e\udd20\\nFriend: fuck im omw to school\\nFriend: ok im trying\\nFriend: 153325\\nFriend: what did u write in topic?\\nFriend: I subm\u016btted\\nFriend: but I will send the email when at school\\nFriend: cuz driving\\nPersona: Only 1 person has 2 do it\\nFriend: okay so we I did submit\\nFriend: I did*\\nFriend: I sent him an email\\nPersona: The format is broken 4 me.

I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.
