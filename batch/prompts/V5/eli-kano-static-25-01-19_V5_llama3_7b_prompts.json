In addition, you will deduct their implicit video game preferences by shadowing chats between the subject and friends. You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n**From most to least related**\n\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky.

In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side.

You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n**From most to least related**\n\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side.

You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n**From most to least related**\n\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side.

You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n**From most to least related**\n\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side.

You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n**From most to least related**\n\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp.

I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.
