I\u2019m helping Samuel and studying hard anyway\\nFriend: Boy, I\u2018m at my grandmas in the mountains and wifi is very bad. Can we maybe call next week instead? \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: Thanks\\nFriend: I\u2019ve send them your info, now it\u2019s in their ballpark if they\u2019ll contact u;)\\nFriend: Transformation and Innovation Management is my specialisation \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: Hahah, it\u2019s called Sustainability Management \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: I might have a small job 4 u. What\u2019s your masters called again? I sold u as a csr transformation consultant:)\\nFriend: Wtf, I could\u2019ve sworn that I didn\u2019t take it with me\\nFriend: I guess that\u2019s fair\ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Everything is good:) sounds good 4 me. Go hard on your vacation!;)\\nFriend: c\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcs, boy! You need to go vegetarian for at least one week as a penalty. I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while. They're a bit high maintenance and inconsistent. Do u still have your student id? Germany has a ridiculous student discount on headspace! The 2nd best is imo 2 use a vpn, and purchase subscription via the Philippines;)\\nFriend: Btw, do you still have like a 'hacked' login for headspace? I'm not having the paid version anymore...\\nFriend: I'm trying to get back in the mode with writing applications :) I've just started today...\\nFriend: Doing pretty good. Exhausted, but only because of good things! Aksel and I had a lot of fun;)\\nFriend: Crossing my fingers! If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last. The restraining order went through \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m just working on a lot of tasks for the police\u2026 \ud83d\ude48\ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: How have u been feeling lately?

I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption.

I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while. They're a bit high maintenance and inconsistent. Do u still have your student id? Germany has a ridiculous student discount on headspace! The 2nd best is imo 2 use a vpn, and purchase subscription via the Philippines;)\\nFriend: Btw, do you still have like a 'hacked' login for headspace? I'm not having the paid version anymore...\\nFriend: I'm trying to get back in the mode with writing applications :) I've just started today...\\nFriend: Doing pretty good.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last.

I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while. They're a bit high maintenance and inconsistent. Do u still have your student id? Germany has a ridiculous student discount on headspace!

I'm not having the paid version anymore...\\nFriend: I'm trying to get back in the mode with writing applications :) I've just started today...\\nFriend: Doing pretty good.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last.

I\u2019m helping Samuel and studying hard anyway\\nFriend: Boy, I\u2018m at my grandmas in the mountains and wifi is very bad. Can we maybe call next week instead? \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: Thanks\\nFriend: I\u2019ve send them your info, now it\u2019s in their ballpark if they\u2019ll contact u;)\\nFriend: Transformation and Innovation Management is my specialisation \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: Hahah, it\u2019s called Sustainability Management \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: I might have a small job 4 u. What\u2019s your masters called again?

Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while. They're a bit high maintenance and inconsistent. Do u still have your student id? Germany has a ridiculous student discount on headspace! The 2nd best is imo 2 use a vpn, and purchase subscription via the Philippines;)\\nFriend: Btw, do you still have like a 'hacked' login for headspace? I'm not having the paid version anymore...\\nFriend: I'm trying to get back in the mode with writing applications :) I've just started today...\\nFriend: Doing pretty good. Exhausted, but only because of good things! Aksel and I had a lot of fun;)\\nFriend: Crossing my fingers! If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last. The restraining order went through \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m just working on a lot of tasks for the police\u2026 \ud83d\ude48\ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: How have u been feeling lately?

Can we maybe call next week instead? \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: Thanks\\nFriend: I\u2019ve send them your info, now it\u2019s in their ballpark if they\u2019ll contact u;)\\nFriend: Transformation and Innovation Management is my specialisation \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: Hahah, it\u2019s called Sustainability Management \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: I might have a small job 4 u. What\u2019s your masters called again?

I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while. They're a bit high maintenance and inconsistent. Do u still have your student id? Germany has a ridiculous student discount on headspace!

I'm not having the paid version anymore...\\nFriend: I'm trying to get back in the mode with writing applications :) I've just started today...\\nFriend: Doing pretty good.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last. The restraining order went through \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m just working on a lot of tasks for the police\u2026 \ud83d\ude48\ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: How have u been feeling lately?

I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already.

It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO.

It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption.

I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while. They're a bit high maintenance and inconsistent. Do u still have your student id? Germany has a ridiculous student discount on headspace! The 2nd best is imo 2 use a vpn, and purchase subscription via the Philippines;)\\nFriend: Btw, do you still have like a 'hacked' login for headspace? I'm not having the paid version anymore...\\nFriend: I'm trying to get back in the mode with writing applications :) I've just started today...\\nFriend: Doing pretty good.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last.

I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while. They're a bit high maintenance and inconsistent. Do u still have your student id? Germany has a ridiculous student discount on headspace!

I'm not having the paid version anymore...\\nFriend: I'm trying to get back in the mode with writing applications :) I've just started today...\\nFriend: Doing pretty good.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last.

I\u2019m helping Samuel and studying hard anyway\\nFriend: Boy, I\u2018m at my grandmas in the mountains and wifi is very bad. Can we maybe call next week instead? \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: Thanks\\nFriend: I\u2019ve send them your info, now it\u2019s in their ballpark if they\u2019ll contact u;)\\nFriend: Transformation and Innovation Management is my specialisation \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: Hahah, it\u2019s called Sustainability Management \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: I might have a small job 4 u. What\u2019s your masters called again?

I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while. They're a bit high maintenance and inconsistent. Do u still have your student id? Germany has a ridiculous student discount on headspace! The 2nd best is imo 2 use a vpn, and purchase subscription via the Philippines;)\\nFriend: Btw, do you still have like a 'hacked' login for headspace? I'm not having the paid version anymore...\\nFriend: I'm trying to get back in the mode with writing applications :) I've just started today...\\nFriend: Doing pretty good. Exhausted, but only because of good things! Aksel and I had a lot of fun;)\\nFriend: Crossing my fingers! If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last. The restraining order went through \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m just working on a lot of tasks for the police\u2026 \ud83d\ude48\ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: How have u been feeling lately?

Can we maybe call next week instead? \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: Thanks\\nFriend: I\u2019ve send them your info, now it\u2019s in their ballpark if they\u2019ll contact u;)\\nFriend: Transformation and Innovation Management is my specialisation \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: Hahah, it\u2019s called Sustainability Management \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: I might have a small job 4 u. What\u2019s your masters called again?

I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while. They're a bit high maintenance and inconsistent. Do u still have your student id? Germany has a ridiculous student discount on headspace!

I'm not having the paid version anymore...\\nFriend: I'm trying to get back in the mode with writing applications :) I've just started today...\\nFriend: Doing pretty good.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption. Hope it really was the last. The restraining order went through \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m just working on a lot of tasks for the police\u2026 \ud83d\ude48\ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: How have u been feeling lately?

I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\\nFriend: It seems like you are more into collaborative organization, management. I am mostly looking for personal knowledge management.\\nFriend: But for managing its also intersting\\nFriend: The new company I work in uses Notion as the main knowledge management tool.\\nFriend: Hey man\\nPersona: I mean that was mostly 4 IMO. Personal I\u2019ve settled with obsidian\\nPersona: Sure, I\u2019m w my study group at Bitlab most of tmr\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: U know, I'll always make time 4 a call w/ my sis if u feel like u need 2 talk\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: This train goes so slow\\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I haven't used these services in a while.

If u wanna talk, I'm not doing anything this evening (the next 4-ish hours):)\\nFriend: How about you? How was the time with Aksel? :)\\nFriend: Yes, there was like one last eruption.
