I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it. If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them.

But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them.

But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them.

But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.
