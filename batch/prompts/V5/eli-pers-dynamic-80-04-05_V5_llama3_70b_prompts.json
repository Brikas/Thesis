Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\\nFriend: when phil didn't understand my paper. I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That\u2019s not bad hahahah\\nFriend: Y DO U ALWAYS FIND THAT\\nPersona: Hhahahaha\\nPersona: Did i send u this before?\\nPersona: We expect 2 be in/around Vancouver 31st July-1st august -ish\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Anazing :)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll be able to spend time with you on July 31st :) but Monday I have work from 8am-7pm\\nPersona: Or timetable is not that firm, so we\u2019ll update u in the meantime\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a okay!!\\nFriend: Monday - Friday (8am-5) I\u2019m generally working.\\nPersona: U In LA tmr?\\nFriend: haiii c: ya I am but only till Sunday because I have work\\nFriend: R u gonna be here\\nPersona: Gonna be there from tmr at 12-13 ish\\nFriend: Is that it???\\nFriend: One day????\\nPersona: Noo, I\u2019ll arrive tmr.

They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I\u2019m about 2 add the sources atm. Can I call u in 20?:)\\nFriend: Don't want to interrupt you :) How are you doing? I think, I'm understanding the modells better now. I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in. If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\\nFriend: when phil didn't understand my paper. I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature. But I'll wake up early instead (my sleep rhythm got me waking up 6 naturally\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: 6 is a good time, true A person\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: great!\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\\nFriend: Maybe you took extra notes from slides?\\nPersona: Yes, it\u2019s nice. I was thinking about creating a big Micro calculator in excel 4 all the things we\u2019ve been through. But then Karol sort of made me rethink it, since the objective is 2 make us able 2 calculate and resonate as it is\\nPersona: Only what I did in class\\nFriend: That would take a while haha\\nFriend: Oh mee too yeah\\nPersona: Yes, and wouldn\u2019t be worth it\\nPersona: Updated CMR\\nPersona: ^Is this enough 2 say? Like r u able 2 find it, just by looking through tags?\\nFriend: ye all good\\nFriend: Same - Updated MCMR\\nPersona: I updated quite some stuff in Micro, and a little in ML\\nFriend: Hey man, thanks, I'll check it out!\\nPersona: Did a few micro notes yesterday, not anything special\\nFriend: Hey, don't delete the date tags yet for this month, I haven't copied info from yours yet\u0104\\nFriend: !*\\nPersona: I did some moving of topics\\nPersona: I didn\u2019t know how 2 show w/ tags.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\\nPersona: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: come anytime\\nFriend: I will use my solo time wisely before u come\\nFriend: Don't wake up early for me btw, I might end up taking the bus and coming at 9\\nPersona: Sounds good.

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them.

Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I see you are enjoying the monkeys\\nPersona: Yeah They where sweet, except when they stole my moms sandwich\\nFriend: Did you pet them?\\nPersona: No actually not, my parents said it was a bad idea\\nPersona: Any news about Bella sky or guldsmeden?\\nFriend: I will need your cv\\nPersona: I Will send it to u now\\nFriend: I will send it to her. She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I've said yes 2 go see a christmas market thing, so would it be cool w/ u if we make it a 1h-long meeting max?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Obedience to Authority\\nFriend: what happened?\\nFriend: Been using Mac for a while now and at work I like it. One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\\nFriend: For example these lines, specifically only triggered when Adobe Acrobat is open saved me so much hassle\\nFriend: Adobe acrobat is very limited in key remappings, so with Autohotkey I can bypass that. Also the annoying copy paste behavior where it adds line breaks is annoying as hell, so this fixes it\\nFriend: Most of then I used for Mindmanager\\nFriend: But I have already made some for Logseq. Already quite a lot I had to make a hotkey to show available hotkeys\\nFriend: Perhaps you know anything similar on MacOS?\\nFriend: This is quite ridiculous\\nPersona: I use better touch tool (if u have the touchbar this is by far the best), but I heard keyboard maestro should be nice as well\\nPersona: Lmao\\nPersona: Lmk if it solves anything 4 u:)\\nPersona: What is .ahk?

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\\nFriend: when phil didn't understand my paper. I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Du har startet en videochat\\nPersona: Videochat afsluttet\\nFriend: Sup dude\\nFriend: What's going on haha\\nPersona: U in the car?\\nFriend: Not yet I'm waiting for the girls to come and pick me up\\nPersona: Cool im joining\\nFriend: Very nice\\nFriend: sithmalp har startet en videochat\\nFriend: Videochat afsluttet\\nFriend: Hey I'll prob skip gym since there's the event\\nPersona: Okay fair, see u at the event then\\nPersona: Gym today?\\nFriend: I'm in Sofia haha\\nPersona: Oh my bad, enjoy with ur girl!\\nFriend: No worries !

A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah"

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention.

I\u2019m about 2 add the sources atm. Can I call u in 20?:)\\nFriend: Don't want to interrupt you :) How are you doing? I think, I'm understanding the modells better now. I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in. If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\\nFriend: when phil didn't understand my paper. I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Hope your project is going good?\\nFriend: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\\nPersona: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\\nFriend: Hm\\nFriend: interesting, I did not\\nFriend: I should\\nFriend: Thank you\\nPersona: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\\nFriend: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\\nFriend: I will check out your too\\nPersona: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\\nPersona: Just looked at our MCMR maps\\nPersona: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\\nFriend: Im done maaaan\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: Goodluck\\nFriend: I've got a small anki deck\\nPersona: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\\nPersona: How did it go?\\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I see you are enjoying the monkeys\\nPersona: Yeah They where sweet, except when they stole my moms sandwich\\nFriend: Did you pet them?\\nPersona: No actually not, my parents said it was a bad idea\\nPersona: Any news about Bella sky or guldsmeden?\\nFriend: I will need your cv\\nPersona: I Will send it to u now\\nFriend: I will send it to her. She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Du har startet en videochat\\nPersona: Videochat afsluttet\\nFriend: Sup dude\\nFriend: What's going on haha\\nPersona: U in the car?\\nFriend: Not yet I'm waiting for the girls to come and pick me up\\nPersona: Cool im joining\\nFriend: Very nice\\nFriend: sithmalp har startet en videochat\\nFriend: Videochat afsluttet\\nFriend: Hey I'll prob skip gym since there's the event\\nPersona: Okay fair, see u at the event then\\nPersona: Gym today?\\nFriend: I'm in Sofia haha\\nPersona: Oh my bad, enjoy with ur girl!\\nFriend: No worries !

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Jacob missed your call.\\nFriend: You missed a call from Jacob.\\nPersona: You called Jacob.\\nFriend: Dalgas have 15\\nFriend: Go on google maps\\nFriend: Should be a 10 min walk from bitlap\\nPersona: Thx\\nFriend: Did you go to the meeting today at 9?\\nPersona: No, I just arrived\\nPersona: U here?\\nFriend: No haha\\nFriend: But I\u2019ll come to the tour\\nFriend: Was just too tired in the morning\\nFriend: I know that the girls have a girls group chat.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend?

I feel like that\u2019s the only real struggle 4 me. Specifically, that the chronology of the paper is coherent, and that it does not jump over 2 big gaps in between paragraphs. Does it make sense?:)\\nFriend: Please don\u2019t read it yet. Only the table of content is worth to look at perhaps. I\u2019m at the visas office rn and feeling pretty stressed out.

I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think.

However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hey man, you going for the cbs skii trip right?\\nPersona: Yea, r u?\\nFriend: I might, not sure yet\\nFriend: How much are u paying ?\\nPersona: Way 2 much I think hahah\\nPersona: 4 smth k\\nFriend: I think it\u2019s above 5k in total lol\\nFriend: Who are you staying in a room with?\\nPersona: Daniel and a couple of girls probably\\nFriend: Hey dude\\nFriend: Which options did you choose here?\\nPersona: I think I said no 2 everything except the bus, and then booked snowboard equipment through intersport\\nPersona: But let me double check 4 u in a few hours\\nFriend: Okay thx man\\nPersona: So only bus, housing and ski pass\\nFriend: Thank you\\nFriend: Got it\\nPersona: Np:)\\nFriend: Hey man, did you hear our ski room considers not going? lol\\nPersona: Yeah it\u2019s pretty messed up\\nPersona: I guess we should make a new group meeting hehe\\nFriend: Ya\\nFriend: Did the girls just tell you they'll keep you posted or?\\nPersona: Yes, but I think they\u2019ll cancel\\nFriend: True\\nPersona: It\u2019ll be fine.

Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Lol.\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Lololll\\nPersona: This should be illegal\\nPersona: And this\\nFriend: I know\\nFriend: Lmaoooo\\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew\\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\\nFriend: Nooo\\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\\nFriend: One day I willll\\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Hiiii\\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Hello!!

As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\\nFriend: I\u2019m out atm.

Therefore, you don't have to stress. When do you have to hand in?\\nFriend: of course :)\\nFriend: The thing I hope u can help me with is the \u201cbird vision\u201d. I feel like that\u2019s the only real struggle 4 me. Specifically, that the chronology of the paper is coherent, and that it does not jump over 2 big gaps in between paragraphs. Does it make sense?:)\\nFriend: Please don\u2019t read it yet. Only the table of content is worth to look at perhaps. I\u2019m at the visas office rn and feeling pretty stressed out. I wanna finish send you the newest draft in an hour (maybe I should put it in docs, so I don\u2019t waste transfer time, and you can see it whenever online\u2026?)\\nFriend: It's still messy.

Maybe check one of the car sharing platforms, if u want it 2 be green into the root;)\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think so. Anyways, greenwashing is just what it is until it ain\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s like manifestation when it\u2019s by a corporation, imo.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll tell her:)\\nFriend: I know Them. But I don\u2019t any strong opinions of them. For nor against\\nFriend: Ronneby\\nFriend: I wanted to apply at Toogoodtogo but was too late. The job posting is offline already...\\nFriend: I applied at Ramboll. Do you think I'm selling my soul? \ud83d\ude2c especially Ramboll sounded like \"real sustainable\" but not sure, could be real good green washing \ud83d\ude48\\nFriend: Maybe she gets it when she has her period like me. If so, magnesium and iron pills help a lot \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: hmmm, does Emma have migraine pills like ibuprofen or paracetamol?\\nFriend: Do you know \"Vestas\" and \"Orsted\"?

So i think u should just throw out your cv 2 everyone, like a weapon of mass destruction!\\nFriend: Eliastorjani\\nFriend: What\u2019s your name on bereal?\\nFriend: I would still apply even though they say u need 2 speak Danish;)\\nFriend: I'm looking into NGOs or political consultancies atm but CPH is though.. most of them offering no jobs at all or you need to speak Danish\\nFriend: Do u expect it 2 be within your domain, or how far r u willing 2 pivot?\ud83d\udc40\\nFriend: I certainly will!!\\nFriend: Tell me, if u know anything interesting in CPH.

The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?"

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That\u2019s not bad hahahah\\nFriend: Y DO U ALWAYS FIND THAT\\nPersona: Hhahahaha\\nPersona: Did i send u this before?\\nPersona: We expect 2 be in/around Vancouver 31st July-1st august -ish\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Anazing :)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll be able to spend time with you on July 31st :) but Monday I have work from 8am-7pm\\nPersona: Or timetable is not that firm, so we\u2019ll update u in the meantime\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a okay!!\\nFriend: Monday - Friday (8am-5) I\u2019m generally working.\\nPersona: U In LA tmr?\\nFriend: haiii c: ya I am but only till Sunday because I have work\\nFriend: R u gonna be here\\nPersona: Gonna be there from tmr at 12-13 ish\\nFriend: Is that it???\\nFriend: One day????\\nPersona: Noo, I\u2019ll arrive tmr.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

I changed the color tho\\nFriend: Hey, checked your additions to the mindmap. Looks good, I like the way you do it, seems like you learned MindManager pretty well. I would say lets collaborate more on semester 2. We should meet again see how we could keep joining our maps consistently.\\nFriend: We could use tags with dates and then when shared easily see whats new.\\nFriend: Also if you like flashcards, we could look into sharing Anki flashcars. They are the most advanced flashcards you could ever find and they are OP.\\nPersona: I\u2019d like that. Idk if it\u2019s possible, but we could create a shared OneDrive folder where we create our collaborative map, and update at the end of each week. Regardless, let\u2019s meet and talk when I get home from ski in February:)\\nFriend: Its not really possible without buying mindmanager to easily colaborate on one file and even with a bought version its not too good. I think if we decide on how do we differentiate which edits are new, we can just send the mindmap to each other, and then quickly join the info to our own mindmaps.\\nFriend: We could try at least.\\nFriend: And yeah, lets talk once you are back!\\nPersona: Way easier 2 show our ideas IRL.

I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: 4 sure\\nFriend: Yaaaay\\nPersona: Is that a nutella pizza?\ud83d\ude1f\\nFriend: Yes\u2026\u2026 yes it is\\nPersona: We've lost u\ud83d\ude33\\nFriend: It\u2019s like nitella bread\\nFriend: It\u2019s good\\nPersona: I guess I can't say anything, I haven't tried it\\nFriend: So donttttt you would like it\\nPersona: I actually think I would, even tho I think it looks and sound disgustaaang\\nFriend: So dramatic\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\\nFriend: What does this mean?\\nPersona: He Said that the 6th pic was cool\\nPersona: And I said u took it\\nFriend: So cute \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc96\\nFriend: Same\\nPersona: Amazing life!\\nFriend: Ir is\\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Hope your project is going good?\\nFriend: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\\nPersona: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\\nFriend: Hm\\nFriend: interesting, I did not\\nFriend: I should\\nFriend: Thank you\\nPersona: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\\nFriend: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\\nFriend: I will check out your too\\nPersona: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\\nPersona: Just looked at our MCMR maps\\nPersona: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\\nFriend: Im done maaaan\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: Goodluck\\nFriend: I've got a small anki deck\\nPersona: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\\nPersona: How did it go?\\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: great!\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\\nFriend: Maybe you took extra notes from slides?\\nPersona: Yes, it\u2019s nice. I was thinking about creating a big Micro calculator in excel 4 all the things we\u2019ve been through. But then Karol sort of made me rethink it, since the objective is 2 make us able 2 calculate and resonate as it is\\nPersona: Only what I did in class\\nFriend: That would take a while haha\\nFriend: Oh mee too yeah\\nPersona: Yes, and wouldn\u2019t be worth it\\nPersona: Updated CMR\\nPersona: ^Is this enough 2 say? Like r u able 2 find it, just by looking through tags?\\nFriend: ye all good\\nFriend: Same - Updated MCMR\\nPersona: I updated quite some stuff in Micro, and a little in ML\\nFriend: Hey man, thanks, I'll check it out!\\nPersona: Did a few micro notes yesterday, not anything special\\nFriend: Hey, don't delete the date tags yet for this month, I haven't copied info from yours yet\u0104\\nFriend: !*\\nPersona: I did some moving of topics\\nPersona: I didn\u2019t know how 2 show w/ tags. Let me show u after class\\nFriend: okay\\nPersona: Also, will u take a quick look at some some code which my group is struggling with?:)\\nFriend: Sure!\\nPersona: Thx\\nFriend: Mindmapping in VR\\nPersona: Yes yes yes and yes\\nPersona: ^Easy mindmap to anki conversion\\nPersona: Btw, do u have 30 min too help me with a minor machine learning problem at some point? (Preferably before noon tmr if possible):)\\nFriend: Hmm maybe\\nFriend: Whats the problem? I dont have time for a meet neither today nor tommorow as I am.working. But on Thursday I am free\\nFriend: Unless its smth quick\\nPersona: It falls under the category of parameter tuning and prediction (don\u2019t know how quick that is). What time will suit u best Thursday?\\nFriend: Maybe around afternoon 11 or 13?\\nPersona: I can do 11:)\\nFriend: Alright\\nPersona: I\u2019ll find a spot in kilen\\nPersona: No free tables.

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8!

Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\\nFriend: I found out they were at another campus, and I actually ended up settling 4 the long walk I was on when talking w/ u:)\\nFriend: Thank you \u263a\ufe0f how was gym yesterday? :)\\nFriend: Try the streetfood market, and go to the canale\\nFriend: Anything else? They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment.

If not, we'll make a new\\nFriend: Yes :) I just got it\u2026 about to wake up \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: It\u2019s a time-sensitive project I guess\\nFriend: A friend of mine (Lise) try 2  reach u on WhatsApp. It\u2019s regarding that green expert thing I told u about this summer\\nFriend: Hey \ud83d\udc93 I\u2019m fine, I started a drawing workshop today. Would have loved to go with you! \ud83e\udd70 how are you? I did get one voice message but I couldn\u2019t really understand anything and then I forgot to answer. Did you figure out your uni schedule already? \ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Do u get my messages?\\nFriend: Hey, how r u?\ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nFriend: Hahaha, can imagine.

Next time, we have to talk earlier in the process \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message. This may take a while.\\nFriend: Hey Bebi \u2764\ufe0f how did the vaccine go? And did they take your paper as delivered? Don\u2019t be sad, if not. In the end everything is worth something \u263a\ufe0f even though you can\u2019t see it in the moment \ud83d\udc95\\nFriend: It\u2019s in the middle of the night 4 me now\\nFriend: We need 2 change our call time\\nFriend: one second\\nFriend: sure :)\\nFriend: Thankyou so much! I\u2019m about 2 add the sources atm. Can I call u in 20?:)\\nFriend: Don't want to interrupt you :) How are you doing? I think, I'm understanding the modells better now. I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in. If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\\nFriend: when phil didn't understand my paper. I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: great!\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\\nFriend: Maybe you took extra notes from slides?\\nPersona: Yes, it\u2019s nice. I was thinking about creating a big Micro calculator in excel 4 all the things we\u2019ve been through. But then Karol sort of made me rethink it, since the objective is 2 make us able 2 calculate and resonate as it is\\nPersona: Only what I did in class\\nFriend: That would take a while haha\\nFriend: Oh mee too yeah\\nPersona: Yes, and wouldn\u2019t be worth it\\nPersona: Updated CMR\\nPersona: ^Is this enough 2 say? Like r u able 2 find it, just by looking through tags?\\nFriend: ye all good\\nFriend: Same - Updated MCMR\\nPersona: I updated quite some stuff in Micro, and a little in ML\\nFriend: Hey man, thanks, I'll check it out!\\nPersona: Did a few micro notes yesterday, not anything special\\nFriend: Hey, don't delete the date tags yet for this month, I haven't copied info from yours yet\u0104\\nFriend: !*\\nPersona: I did some moving of topics\\nPersona: I didn\u2019t know how 2 show w/ tags.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

In the end everything is worth something \u263a\ufe0f even though you can\u2019t see it in the moment \ud83d\udc95\\nFriend: It\u2019s in the middle of the night 4 me now\\nFriend: We need 2 change our call time\\nFriend: one second\\nFriend: sure :)\\nFriend: Thankyou so much! I\u2019m about 2 add the sources atm. Can I call u in 20?:)\\nFriend: Don't want to interrupt you :) How are you doing? I think, I'm understanding the modells better now. I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in. If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\\nFriend: when phil didn't understand my paper. I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: glad you solved the isue\\nPersona: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\\nFriend: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\\nPersona: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\\nFriend: Hm\\nFriend: interesting, I did not\\nFriend: I should\\nFriend: Thank you\\nPersona: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\\nFriend: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\\nFriend: I will check out your too\\nPersona: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\\nPersona: Just looked at our MCMR maps\\nPersona: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\\nFriend: Im done maaaan\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: Goodluck\\nFriend: I've got a small anki deck\\nPersona: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\\nPersona: How did it go?\\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: come anytime\\nFriend: I will use my solo time wisely before u come\\nFriend: Don't wake up early for me btw, I might end up taking the bus and coming at 9\\nPersona: Sounds good. I\u2019ll text u when I\u2019m headed towards u;)\\nFriend: I will be after 9 just fyi, having a slow mornning \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Which campus should we go to\\nFriend: I hope we can find place\\nPersona: Holy shit. Just opened eyes\\nPersona: Where r u?\\nFriend: I went and found a room is SP\\nFriend: in*\\nFriend: Long night? \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: dont stress about it, I will be at CBS until end of working day probably\\nPersona: Football was though on my body!\\nPersona: Amazing! Which?\\nPersona: Ill leave in 10\\nFriend: 1.14\\nFriend: Have you had food already?\\nPersona: Just got a couple of toasts, but let\u2019s go get more;)\\nFriend: alright, will wait for u\\nFriend: Hey can you send me the whiteboard?\\nPersona: Sry just saw your msg\\nFriend: thanks and no worries, I am just sitting down to think about it right now \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: Game theory mighht be indeed very related to agent based simulations\\nFriend: and this is an extract from an intorudciton to CAS (complex adaptive systems)\\nFriend: I had this idea in the Shower.\n\n\"Using MaamSim to simulate a Danish delivery business without NLP Agents and then with to see how they affect the simulation outcome\"\\nFriend: as a starter could be interesting\\nPersona: Where would NLP agents fit into that sim? Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree. KMS' r boring for specific organizations, and I would only find it interesting if we could approach it a bit more abstract/theoretical, 2 think of a general purpose (what I think u describe as \"external\"?) approach to knwl mgmt\\nFriend: we modify the code\\nFriend: publicy available knowledge management\\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in? Maybe it\u2019s hard 2 talk about over text\\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: Me2! Am ready as early as u want;)\\nFriend: Alright, so lets talk tommorow!\\nFriend: What about 10-11am?\\nPersona: Sounds good\\nPersona: I\u2019ll be there at 10\\nPersona: Got kicked, nvm\\nFriend: I am just leaving\\nFriend: if I can find a parking at SP I'll be quick\\nPersona: No stress. I'm catching up in the meantime\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure.

Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\\nFriend: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\\nPersona: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\\nFriend: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\\nPersona: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\\nFriend: THe GPT on Google is nice\\nFriend: but I can't find the summarizer\\nFriend: Is it this one?\\nPersona: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\\nFriend: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\\nFriend: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\\nPersona: Ofc;)\\nFriend: Alright I'll get it\\nPersona: R u at CBS?\\nFriend: Hey, nah at home, studying\\nFriend: but whats up?\\nPersona: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\\nPersona: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\\nFriend: Which excel sheet?\\nPersona: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\\nFriend: I see, wait\\nFriend: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\\nPersona: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\\nFriend: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\\nFriend: In my study group we made a new template\\nFriend: If you want, I can share this with you\\nFriend: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\\nPersona: Would appreciate that<3\\nFriend: The sheet at the end are not really templates\\nFriend: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\\nFriend: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\\nFriend: sheets*\\nPersona: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\\nFriend: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\\nPersona: Thanks bro!\\nFriend: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Pretty well.

I just arrived home safely:)\\nFriend: Hey, have you used Notion?\\nPersona: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\\nPersona: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\\nFriend: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\\nPersona: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)"

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature. But I'll wake up early instead (my sleep rhythm got me waking up 6 naturally\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: 6 is a good time, true A person\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: glad you solved the isue\\nPersona: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\\nFriend: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\\nPersona: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\\nFriend: Hm\\nFriend: interesting, I did not\\nFriend: I should\\nFriend: Thank you\\nPersona: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\\nFriend: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\\nFriend: I will check out your too\\nPersona: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\\nPersona: Just looked at our MCMR maps\\nPersona: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\\nFriend: Im done maaaan\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: Goodluck\\nFriend: I've got a small anki deck\\nPersona: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\\nPersona: How did it go?\\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Lol.\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Lololll\\nPersona: This should be illegal\\nPersona: And this\\nFriend: I know\\nFriend: Lmaoooo\\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew\\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\\nFriend: Nooo\\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\\nFriend: One day I willll\\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Hiiii\\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Hello!!

Maybe you can argue for whatever point you wanna make, with sources you already have?\\nFriend: Hm, maybe you have to think of different steps and loops you have to take to finish an essay/paper.

It\u2019s good!\\nFriend: I\u2019d rather Hand in at the re-exam (it\u2019s the same assignment) than 2 hand in smth I\u2019m not proud of. The conclusion paragraph won\u2019t be hard, it\u2019s the analysis stuff that bugs me - 2 find citations from old academics on a future topic\\nFriend: It\u2019s one of your first papers. I think, you don\u2019t have to be perfect. You can see it as a first trial, no? :) and in any case you learned a lot for the next time regarding time management and structuring stuff. :)\\nFriend: Do you have grammarly or a similar Programm?

I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend?

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature. But I'll wake up early instead (my sleep rhythm got me waking up 6 naturally\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: 6 is a good time, true A person\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: without any hacking lol\\nFriend: You'll laugh when I tell you about this\\nFriend: Their security system is literally so flawed.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\\nFriend: I\u2019m out atm. But gonna be back in 2h :)\\nFriend: ^Here it is. I think the structure is already better, and I have 2 take a break 2 eat now\\nFriend: Better done than perfect, honey! \ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: oki, just send it to me when you feel like sending.\\nFriend: At 11.00 tmr\\nFriend: I'm pretty flexible today. Therefore, you don't have to stress. When do you have to hand in?\\nFriend: of course :)\\nFriend: The thing I hope u can help me with is the \u201cbird vision\u201d. I feel like that\u2019s the only real struggle 4 me. Specifically, that the chronology of the paper is coherent, and that it does not jump over 2 big gaps in between paragraphs. Does it make sense?:)\\nFriend: Please don\u2019t read it yet. Only the table of content is worth to look at perhaps. I\u2019m at the visas office rn and feeling pretty stressed out. I wanna finish send you the newest draft in an hour (maybe I should put it in docs, so I don\u2019t waste transfer time, and you can see it whenever online\u2026?)\\nFriend: It's still messy.

Did they meet 190?\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nFriend: yeah lets do it\\nFriend: oh wait nvm\\nFriend: I thought you texted me, but I was just reading an old message xddd\\nFriend: what is the table with LLMs you always bring up?\\nPersona: Chatbot arena leadberboard\\nPersona: At huggingface\\nFriend: ncie thx\\nFriend: Tuesday 8 AM he invited for a meeting\\nPersona: perfect\\nPersona: I added some guys in the docs from SI\\nFriend: I sent to chriatianr\\nFriend: lovely\\nFriend: we do the template first, or targeted?\\nPersona: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\\nFriend: ok wait, I'll review them\\nFriend: why not idea 3?\\nFriend: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nPersona: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nPersona: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nFriend: ok I am checking them rn\\nFriend: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nFriend: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nFriend: I had one chance and I took it\\nPersona: Don't stress it\\nFriend: i think i agree with you\\nFriend: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nFriend: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nFriend: I wrote in green\\nFriend: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nPersona: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nFriend: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nFriend: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nPersona: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Jacob missed your call.\\nFriend: You missed a call from Jacob.\\nPersona: You called Jacob.\\nFriend: Dalgas have 15\\nFriend: Go on google maps\\nFriend: Should be a 10 min walk from bitlap\\nPersona: Thx\\nFriend: Did you go to the meeting today at 9?\\nPersona: No, I just arrived\\nPersona: U here?\\nFriend: No haha\\nFriend: But I\u2019ll come to the tour\\nFriend: Was just too tired in the morning\\nFriend: I know that the girls have a girls group chat. Should we make one too?\\nPersona: I just went home as well. I wanna sleep a bit before the tour\\nPersona: U didn't miss anything\\nPersona: Sure we could make one. Is it all of the girls in DM?\\nFriend: Probably not all of them but I thought a bigger group would be good to keep in touch\u2026\\nPersona: sure thing. But exclusively 4 boys?\\nPersona: Maybe we should just make 1 for everyone on FB?\\nFriend: No let\u2019s include girls\\nFriend: Yes\\nPersona: Let's mention it at the dinners\\nFriend: Perfect\\nFriend: When are u playing?\\nPersona: 14.00 probably\\nFriend: What bar r u going?\\nPersona: I'm about 2 leave\\nPersona: 2 meet the others\\nPersona: Idk where they're at/going tho\\nFriend: Ahh so u are going to the bar rn?\\nPersona: Idk, just wanna meet up and get drunk\\nFriend: Hahaha sounds good\\nPersona: Let's get out now\\nFriend: I\u2019ll be there in 35 min\\nPersona: You'll be late 4 a spot bro\\nFriend: Ok I\u2019m on my way\\nFriend: But I need 20 min\\nFriend: Can you save a spot for me\\nPersona: I'll do my best\\nPersona: Its lit\\nPersona: Where r u sitting?\\nFriend: In the back\\nFriend: But on my way to Cantine rn\\nPersona: What number is your study group?\\nFriend: 21\\nFriend: Where r u\\nPersona: Generally, your paragraphs are too short. It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

Luckily I got u covered from there:)\\nFriend: Im done maaaan\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: Goodluck\\nFriend: I've got a small anki deck\\nPersona: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\\nPersona: How did it go?\\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: Thanks\\nPersona: That is way too much Nikolay, I\u2019ll invite u on a chicken date at the place in Frederiksberg when they open again\\nFriend: It\u2019s why I pay for a haircut\\nPersona: That confirms that I have to introduce u to my barber\\nPersona: Chicken today?\\nFriend: I won\u2019t be able to I think I will play football\\nFriend: With the boys\\nPersona: no worries, another day\\nFriend: Hahahah\\nFriend: How is this done\\nFriend: And it looks so silly\\nPersona: It\u2019s with a 360 camera I think\\nPersona: With a mount on the hips, but the camera makes it invisible\\nFriend: It looks so silly\\nFriend: Hahahah\\nPersona: I Think it\u2019s kind of cool\\nPersona: U live in one of these apartments?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Florensvej 14\\nFriend: Is my address. This is sydhavn\\nPersona: No it's amager\\nPersona: You sent an attachment.\\nFriend: Bro\\nFriend: Regarding the ass bleeding, my suggestion would be to sort it out ASAP\\nFriend: I have full on anemia\\nFriend: Due to this\\nFriend: And the only reason is that I haven\u2019t sorted it out early enough\\nPersona: Is that a permanent thing?\\nPersona: thanks for telling me bro!\\nPersona: I will call the specialist in the morning\\nFriend: No no\\nFriend: Basically when you loose blood\\nFriend: You loose iron\\nFriend: And iron is important for the transport of oxygen in your blood\\nFriend: My levels were 3.7 when I took the blood test\\nFriend: On average a man has between 7 and 8\\nPersona: I can't really comprehend how serious this anaemia is. But since u r warning me it must be bad?\\nFriend: I mean the symptoms vary a lot between people\\nFriend: In my car\\nFriend: Case\\nFriend: My skin got yellowish\\nFriend: Light headed sometimes when I get up too quickly\\nFriend: Running out of breath when running\\nFriend: Very quickly\\nPersona: Does not sound to nice\\nFriend: No\\nPersona: Did u get the operation?\\nFriend: It could also be loss of apetite, weight etc\\nFriend: I don\u2019t have any of this\\nFriend: Also tiredness\\nFriend: I had this one partially\\nFriend: Probably next week\\nFriend: Getting last check tomorrow\\nFriend: Before the actual surgery\\nPersona: Some of these side effects sounds like me. But maybe it's a coincidence\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been to the normal doctor, which have sent me to the specialist, whom I\u2019m calling tomorrow\\nPersona: Good luck with all the surgery, let me know how it goes!\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know how much blood you are loosing\\nFriend: And for how long\\nFriend: But I would\nSuggest ask for a blood test\\nFriend: And check your levels of hemoglobin\\nPersona: I actually had a blood test (unrelated to this) I'll check the haemoglobin now\\nFriend: I got a phone call directly after mine\\nFriend: And they asked me if I am still alive\\nFriend: Hahaha\\nPersona: What! Hahahahaha\\nPersona: Because of the 3,7?\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: It\u2019s veeeeey low\\nFriend: Less than half\\nPersona: I don't think it is as urgent for me.

R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature. But I'll wake up early instead (my sleep rhythm got me waking up 6 naturally\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: 6 is a good time, true A person\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Cutest \ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It's fine, I'll take whatever time u got:)\\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8!

I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\\nFriend: when phil didn't understand my paper. I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc."

Don\u2019t bother\\nFriend: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\\nFriend: I will check out your too\\nPersona: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\\nPersona: Just looked at our MCMR maps\\nPersona: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\\nFriend: Im done maaaan\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: Goodluck\\nFriend: I've got a small anki deck\\nPersona: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\\nPersona: How did it go?\\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Lol.\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Lololll\\nPersona: This should be illegal\\nPersona: And this\\nFriend: I know\\nFriend: Lmaoooo\\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew\\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\\nFriend: Nooo\\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\\nFriend: One day I willll\\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Hiiii\\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Hello!!

Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\\nFriend: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\\nPersona: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\\nFriend: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\\nPersona: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\\nFriend: THe GPT on Google is nice\\nFriend: but I can't find the summarizer\\nFriend: Is it this one?\\nPersona: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\\nFriend: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\\nFriend: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\\nPersona: Ofc;)\\nFriend: Alright I'll get it\\nPersona: R u at CBS?\\nFriend: Hey, nah at home, studying\\nFriend: but whats up?\\nPersona: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time.

I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\\nFriend: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\\nFriend: In my study group we made a new template\\nFriend: If you want, I can share this with you\\nFriend: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\\nPersona: Would appreciate that<3\\nFriend: The sheet at the end are not really templates\\nFriend: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\\nFriend: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\\nFriend: sheets*\\nPersona: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\\nFriend: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\\nPersona: Thanks bro!\\nFriend: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Pretty well.

Why?\\nPersona: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\\nFriend: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\\nPersona: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: without any hacking lol\\nFriend: You'll laugh when I tell you about this\\nFriend: Their security system is literally so flawed.

Logged in at play.aspiri, got the code to my phone, then changed the number back to yours.\\nPersona: This text is killing me!\\nFriend: Well I'll ask for a comparable bounty xd\\nFriend: Given that they have just lost 700 kr. becaue of us exploiting it, I would ask for a 10 000kr + bounty\\nFriend: bounty hunting is a real and legit thing if you find exploits\\nFriend: Companies pay for that\\nPersona: Go get them!\ud83e\udee1\\nFriend: Its a low chance this would work, but I could try after the exam\\nPersona: I hope u get it\\nFriend: Well if I get it, we split \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: but I'll go do econ now\\nFriend: Hey, what is the calculator that you got?\\nPersona: At sp school supplies they sell it\\nFriend: How much you paid?\\nPersona: about 350\\nPersona: If u want, u can try my calculator before buying\\nFriend: Hey, whats your mobile pay number?\\nPersona: 24340011\\nFriend: Alright\\nFriend: aspiri dk is just next to cbs\\nPersona: But we r inside already:p\\nFriend: hoes econ going?\\nPersona: I guess okay.

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?
