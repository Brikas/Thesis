She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.
