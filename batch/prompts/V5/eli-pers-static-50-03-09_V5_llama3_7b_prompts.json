I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come?

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

But I\u2019m down 4 a challenge\\nPersona: U know we got class at the same time tho, righty\\nFriend: I will check it out further\\nFriend: Will write to u further about this\\nFriend: if I find time to read more\\nPersona: Sure. I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

But I\u2019m down 4 a challenge\\nPersona: U know we got class at the same time tho, righty\\nFriend: I will check it out further\\nFriend: Will write to u further about this\\nFriend: if I find time to read more\\nPersona: Sure. I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

But I\u2019m down 4 a challenge\\nPersona: U know we got class at the same time tho, righty\\nFriend: I will check it out further\\nFriend: Will write to u further about this\\nFriend: if I find time to read more\\nPersona: Sure. I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github.

I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah I know I know, I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s kinda hard\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know if you remember that girl from Poland that was always on his back\\nPersona: I texted him, but he didn't answer\\nFriend: She\u2019s coming here next month\\nPersona: 2 visit Goncalo?\\nFriend: I don\u2019t think he feels like talking to anyone right now, he will probably answer later\\nFriend: Yes\u2026.. When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Yes!\\nPersona: How r u getting there?\\nFriend: I am taking the car?\\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\\nFriend: I can drive you back\\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late. I\u2019ll go directly 2 autonomous systems if I can before they start, otherwise I\u2019ll talk w/ stance\\nPersona: I\u2019m here\\nFriend: me too\\nFriend: just came\\nFriend: im so confused\\nFriend: dude it took me so long\\nFriend: to\\nFriend: find\\nFriend: I pushed some extra KLC and RM notes\\nFriend: ugh I hate github. Everytime there is a new error\\nFriend: Can you rename one of the files later?\\nFriend: Logseq keeps identifies all md at the same level\\nFriend: Yo mate\\nFriend: Should we try?\\nPersona: I was about 2 txt u\\nFriend: Ahaha what a coincidence\\nPersona: Don\u2019t 100% know what it\u2019s about. But I\u2019m down 4 a challenge\\nPersona: U know we got class at the same time tho, righty\\nFriend: I will check it out further\\nFriend: Will write to u further about this\\nFriend: if I find time to read more\\nPersona: Sure. I\u2019m fixing everything after a new factory reset later today. I keep on breaking shit\\nFriend: ahh, dont worry too much\\nPersona: Why aren\u2019t u in class?\\nFriend: I am a bit stressed out about the elective retake deadline + aplications to masters\\nFriend: so I got home after work instead and are working on this\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: I\u2019ll push in the evening\\nFriend: Do you want to go?\\nFriend: The Tour de Chambre\\nFriend: Hey mate, I will have to leave you on your own for todays lecture\\nFriend: Important friday at work\\nPersona: I didn't sign up yet. Had full focus on MSc application\\nPersona: Don't worry about it. I'm buried in signing up 4 couses all over DK 2 compensate my missing courses (IS will be my 1st priority)\\nFriend: What did you end up applying for?\\nFriend: or still busy applying haha and I should ask in 30mins?\\nPersona: CBS: 1. Information systems, 2. Data science, 3. Advanced economics and finance. \nDTU: Technology and entrepreneurship\\nFriend: sounds good\\nFriend: I applied for MIB, OIE and DB in CBS\\nFriend: and also the DTU one of course\\nPersona: I was also close at picking MIBD, but thought I was 2 disadvantaged w/o a job\\nPersona: R u about 2 be ready again? Or did the retake deadline not hit yet?\\nFriend: Yeah, did the exam\\nFriend: Ready to work\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?
