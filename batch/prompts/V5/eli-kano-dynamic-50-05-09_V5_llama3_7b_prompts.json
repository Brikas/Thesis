He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting!

So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah it\u2019s gonna be about that\\nFriend: The problem with buying is then selling it\\nPersona: We\u2019ll just give it away 2 u or smth I guess\\nPersona: Or sell 2 a place taking the raw materials if u don\u2019t have space\\nFriend: Ahh okay makes sense\\nFriend: how did the presenation go\\nPersona: We got a 7\\nFriend: thats good\\nFriend: what questions did he ask\\nFriend: Thank you\\nFriend: Yeah I heard that he is terrible\\nFriend: What time are you going to the park\\nPersona: I\u2019m coming around 20-ish\\nFriend: Ahh okay cool\\nPersona: Christian missed your call.\\nFriend: What\u2019s up\\nPersona: R u there?\\nFriend: Yeah\\nPersona: How long r u staying in the park?\\nPersona: We r between u and nexus\\nFriend: Christian called you.\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: I feel bad about leaving without saying goodbye 2 Michael and Anna.

Hope your project is going good?\\nFriend: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\\nPersona: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\\nFriend: Hm\\nFriend: interesting, I did not\\nFriend: I should\\nFriend: Thank you\\nPersona: I just tried it myself.

But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm my way out of the library.

Wanna talk soon?:)\\nFriend: The knot couldn\u2019t take anymore\u2026 I wore it till the material literally decomposed!\\nFriend: Get well soon!\\nFriend: I got very sick on the weekend and can\u2019t really talk \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Still calling at 17:00 today (10 CET)\\nFriend: Perfect\\nFriend: Perhaps it\u2019s better if we call u when we\u2019re on the hotels WiFi in an hour\u2026?\\nFriend: Did you arrive safely? :)\\nFriend: After is better for me :)\\nFriend: Is after better 4 u?\\nFriend: We land 22, so 15 your time\\nFriend: We fly 19 CH time (12 your time)\\nFriend: We r flying tmr evening, so do u think it\u2019ll be very late before u got time?\\nFriend: I just found some time and wanted 2 match what was best 4 u, but now I think tmr is better\\nFriend: You wanted to call today?\\nFriend: Yes, no worries.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term"

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting!

But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends"

And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Miss uuuu\\nPersona: Miss u 2!\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love it\\nFriend: Aaaaah so cute omg!!!!\\nFriend: What happened???\\nPersona: I blackouted and hit my head yesterday\\nFriend: Oh Nikki\\nFriend: Noooo * wtf ahahaha\\nFriend: But is it serious?\\nPersona: It\u2019s okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s really nice\\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol\\nPersona: CMR is organised in 2 levels now\\nPersona: Will wait 2 update w/ your input till tmr, 2 make it more convenient 4 u\\nPersona: I will also wait with applying our tags till next week\\nFriend: great!\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now.

I was thinking about creating a big Micro calculator in excel 4 all the things we\u2019ve been through.

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: will continue writing it now \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Ok I wrote a killer proposal\\nFriend: Hey mate\\nFriend: can you review\\nFriend: its in the doc on the first page\\nFriend: Hey so should I send it?\\nPersona: I\u2019m reading it now, sry forgot\\nFriend: No worries, I totally understand \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Amazing! How do you like; \u201cMarket research via LLM persona adoption and focus group simulation\u201d for the topic/theme instead?\\nPersona: Other than that, the proposal seems flawless 2 me. I didn\u2019t expect it 2 be so throughly:)\\nPersona: Student number: 153852\\nPersona: Can I get u 2 fill this out on canvas? The deadline is today. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s noon or midnight\u2026\\nPersona: That\u2019s an accurate description!\ud83e\udd20\\nFriend: fuck im omw to school\\nFriend: ok im trying\\nFriend: 153325\\nFriend: what did u write in topic?\\nFriend: I subm\u016btted\\nFriend: but I will send the email when at school\\nFriend: cuz driving\\nPersona: Only 1 person has 2 do it\\nFriend: okay so we I did submit\\nFriend: I did*\\nFriend: I sent him an email\\nPersona: The format is broken 4 me. Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them"

And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Oh shit, was working\\nFriend: Not ready yet?\\nFriend: nice :)\\nFriend: but you can also just call when you have time. will be in the cafe working\\nFriend: hmhm, I'm leaving in 5min here\\nFriend: We r biking the next 20m\\nFriend: maybe in 1.5 hours? :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m just about to get up.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\\nFriend: I found out they were at another campus, and I actually ended up settling 4 the long walk I was on when talking w/ u:)\\nFriend: Thank you \u263a\ufe0f how was gym yesterday? :)\\nFriend: Try the streetfood market, and go to the canale\\nFriend: Anything else? They already have a place to stay as they are there right now\\nFriend: Go 2 ARoS, the museum. Also, there\u2019s a pretty cheap hostel where u stay in pods and has a pretty nice environment. I can\u2019t remember the name, but I can find it if you\u2019re interested?\\nFriend: Do you have tips for what to do in Aarhus? :) A friend asked \u270c\ud83c\udffc\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: what is the table with LLMs you always bring up?\\nPersona: Chatbot arena leadberboard\\nPersona: At huggingface\\nFriend: ncie thx\\nFriend: Tuesday 8 AM he invited for a meeting\\nPersona: perfect\\nPersona: I added some guys in the docs from SI\\nFriend: I sent to chriatianr\\nFriend: lovely\\nFriend: we do the template first, or targeted?\\nPersona: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\\nFriend: ok wait, I'll review them\\nFriend: why not idea 3?\\nFriend: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nPersona: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nPersona: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nFriend: ok I am checking them rn\\nFriend: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nFriend: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nFriend: I had one chance and I took it\\nPersona: Don't stress it\\nFriend: i think i agree with you\\nFriend: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nFriend: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nFriend: I wrote in green\\nFriend: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nPersona: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nFriend: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nFriend: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nPersona: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Filip called you.\\nFriend: Are you walking by the grocery store?\\nFriend: Did you find it?\\nPersona: Why didn\u2019t u come along?\\nPersona: We r all in the big apartment\\nFriend: Wanted to get food first\\nPersona: U could have just eaten here\\nFriend: But kimiah said that they\u2019re cooking so i\u2019m coming\\nPersona: Did the girls ask u 2 come?\\nFriend: Did yall start eating?\\nPersona: Or they just left?\\nPersona: No\\nFriend: Sweet\\nFriend: Be there soon\\nPersona: ?\\nFriend: Nah bro, i asked them if they\u2019re going out \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: So idk if they\u2019d say if i didnt ask lol\\nPersona: This is getting pretty annoying\\nFriend: Yeah it is\\nFriend: But i dont give a shit man\\nPersona: I think we should talk 2 the girls, when u r done skiing\\nFriend: Yeah maybe\\nFriend: Where are you now?\\nPersona: At the big apartment\\nFriend: Filip called you.\\nFriend: Filip called you.\\nPersona: You called Filip.\\nFriend: Filip called you.\\nPersona: You called Filip.\\nFriend: You wanna take my skis and come up?\\nPersona: Bro, I don\u2019t think I can\\nFriend: I wanted to send that at 1pm lol\\nPersona: Oh well\\nFriend: You missed a call from Filip.\\nPersona: Filip missed your call.\\nPersona: CPh village\\nPersona: The doorms we talked about\\nFriend: Thanks Man, i\u2019ll check it out\\nFriend: Did you read for econ?\\nPersona: No, didn\u2019t get 2 it\\nPersona: Don\u2019t u have mobile pay?\\nFriend: Yeah I do\\nFriend: 81939760\\nPersona: Got u\\nFriend: Thx\\nFriend: Filip called you.\\nFriend: Did you guys end up playing?\\nPersona: Nope\\nFriend: I see\\nFriend: Hey man, any plans for tonight?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol\\nPersona: CMR is organised in 2 levels now\\nPersona: Will wait 2 update w/ your input till tmr, 2 make it more convenient 4 u\\nPersona: I will also wait with applying our tags till next week\\nFriend: great!\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\\nFriend: Maybe you took extra notes from slides?\\nPersona: Yes, it\u2019s nice. I was thinking about creating a big Micro calculator in excel 4 all the things we\u2019ve been through. But then Karol sort of made me rethink it, since the objective is 2 make us able 2 calculate and resonate as it is\\nPersona: Only what I did in class\\nFriend: That would take a while haha\\nFriend: Oh mee too yeah\\nPersona: Yes, and wouldn\u2019t be worth it\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: U and Julian?\\nFriend: yeah and one of my friends\\nPersona: But nothing before?\\nFriend: no\\nPersona: Sry bro, it seems like almost no one is going\\nFriend: You think so\\nPersona: I\u2019m staying in tn:/\\nFriend: Really\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be late\\nPersona: I know u and Julian\\nFriend: Why do u say that\\nPersona: That\u2019s it\\nFriend: Okay and\\nPersona: Maybe Alfred, but late\\nPersona: And I can\u2019t really get in the drinking mood rn tbf\\nFriend: Fuck damn okay\\nFriend: We go out tomo\\nFriend: So we are going out tonight\\nFriend: Ohh okay fine\\nFriend: Have fun\\nPersona: Thx, u 2:)\\nFriend: What are u wearing for the party Saturday\\nFriend: Ahh makes sense\\nFriend: That\u2019s what I was going for\\nFriend: Yeah I was\\nFriend: Are u going to class tomo\\nPersona: Yes.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Miss uuuu\\nPersona: Miss u 2!\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love it\\nFriend: Aaaaah so cute omg!!!!\\nFriend: What happened???\\nPersona: I blackouted and hit my head yesterday\\nFriend: Oh Nikki\\nFriend: Noooo * wtf ahahaha\\nFriend: But is it serious?\\nPersona: It\u2019s okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s really nice\\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I\u2019m down just let me know when\\nPersona: Sry bro, I feel 2 exhausted 2 party\\nFriend: Okay I get it see you tomo\\nFriend: What are you doing tonight\\nPersona: A birthday pub crawl with primary school guys\\nPersona: Wbu?\\nFriend: Ahhh okay sounds fun\\nFriend: Not sure yet\\nPersona: Go 4 the rave:P\\nFriend: Hahahah\\nPersona: Can I bring my friend Bastian?

Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Got time until 13;)\\nFriend: Oh nooooo, I forgot about yesterday.

She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Got time until 13;)\\nFriend: Oh nooooo, I forgot about yesterday.

Can u plz talk 2 him? I think he\u2019s feeling lonely since everybody defaults 2 their mother tongue, and everyone but him got an exclusive language - as well as established lives already in the city. I think u have been the best example I\u2019ve seen of establishing contact in a place similar 2 Sam\u2019s situation. Sry 4 ranting. I can\u2019t help but being upset on his behalf, and I feel a little responsible bc I encouraged him 2 seek a project\\nFriend: That\u2019s fair. I understand\\nFriend: I think so :) wanted to show Nuh the city and spend some \u201cromantic\u201d time as I\u2019m at my German parents right now for some more days, having a lot of viewings with my dad and cannot see Nuh. \ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Maaaan, I got super sick again.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting!

But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: we can investigate if u have time\\nPersona: Cool.

Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree.

I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!"

Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents.

Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Miss uuuu\\nPersona: Miss u 2!\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love it\\nFriend: Aaaaah so cute omg!!!!\\nFriend: What happened???\\nPersona: I blackouted and hit my head yesterday\\nFriend: Oh Nikki\\nFriend: Noooo * wtf ahahaha\\nFriend: But is it serious?\\nPersona: It\u2019s okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s really nice\\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: we can investigate if u have time\\nPersona: Cool.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: He Said that the 6th pic was cool\\nPersona: And I said u took it\\nFriend: So cute \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc96\\nFriend: Same\\nPersona: Amazing life!\\nFriend: Ir is\\nFriend: It\\nPersona: Ain\u2019t Got money 2 travel.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo.

They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents.

Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment.

Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\\nFriend: Maybe you took extra notes from slides?\\nPersona: Yes, it\u2019s nice. I was thinking about creating a big Micro calculator in excel 4 all the things we\u2019ve been through. But then Karol sort of made me rethink it, since the objective is 2 make us able 2 calculate and resonate as it is\\nPersona: Only what I did in class\\nFriend: That would take a while haha\\nFriend: Oh mee too yeah\\nPersona: Yes, and wouldn\u2019t be worth it\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done.

And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it).

But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration.

And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind.

I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

They say no, bc it takes a long time 4 the plastic 2 break down. Then they say that it\u2019s understandable that he lives in the draining system, bc he\u2019s a polluting asshole\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Awww\\nFriend: Agreed\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Where are you\\nPersona: We r in Plovdiv\\nFriend: Oh jisuss\\nFriend: Did the new girl arrive??\\nPersona: No she\u2019s coming tmr\\nFriend: Ohh true\\nFriend: I love this placee\\nFriend: Go to the skapto para\\nPersona: What is the slapto para? I googled it\\nFriend: It's a restaurant\\nFriend: The best burger place ever\\nPersona: Okayyyyy!\\nPersona: I guess I\u2019ll need 2 try it tomorrow\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term"

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow.

But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That\u2019s Shanghai right?\\nFriend: I mean u can - but it\u2019s a very international city as well\\nPersona: Yeah, was that also where u went 2 high school?\\nFriend: It\u2019s a great city and a lot of young people as well\\nFriend: I was in Beijing\\nPersona: I exactly what I wished 2 hear:)\\nFriend: But I\u2019ve been to shanghai loads\\nFriend: Sports trips and stuff\\nPersona: I\u2019m getting a little stoked now\\nFriend: It\u2019ll be super exciting\\nPersona: R u happy u got to Taiwan?\\nFriend: Honestly I\u2019ve overlooked that university- thought hongkong was the only place available\\nFriend: Yea I can\u2019t wait !! It\u2019s gonna be so nice to do smth different - bit tired of dk\\nPersona: Fudan? Or the one u got into?\\nFriend: Fudan\\nFriend: Didn\u2019t realize it was available\\nPersona: When is your semester scheduled? R u gonna travel before?\\nFriend: I\u2019ve got an internship in Cambodia before\\nFriend: Then I\u2019m going straight to Taiwan\\nFriend: But I\u2019m traveling loads after\\nPersona: Damn bro. U got vacation\\nFriend: Basically\\nFriend: Ahha\\nPersona: Mine is ending in January unfortunately, so I think traveling afterwards would be hard 4 me:/\\nFriend: Idk when we start again - prob in feb\\nFriend: But I mean u could miss a bit\\nFriend: Wouldn\u2019t do much harm\\nPersona: True\\nPersona: The last semester should be kind of loose I think\\nFriend: Definitely\\nFriend: This semester is also gonna be chill I think\\nFriend: Everything is home assignments\\nPersona: Yeah, but kind of disappointing that there is so little group work\\nFriend: Yea I guess but then u don\u2019t really have to consult and chose ur own work time\\nFriend: Haven\u2019t been to class yet tho\\nFriend: Is it interesting?\\nPersona: Me neither\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been skiing and sick\\nPersona: Do u think Shanghai and Taiwan can be shit bc of Covid?\\nFriend: I think it\u2019ll be less problematic in Taiwan but potentially in china - cause it\u2019s going a bit crazy now\\nFriend: But I mean recent policies are just that they don\u2019t care\\nPersona: Shit\\nFriend: So if they just keep everything open it it might nor affect u too much\\nPersona: I\u2019m probably not even going 2 check any news about it. I\u2019d rather just roll with it I guess\\nFriend: It would only be depressing haha\\nFriend: Maybe try grab a booster shot before going down there tho\\nFriend: Ahha\\nFriend: hey bro\\nFriend: think you mentioned at one point that u knew a bit about financial aid and where to apply\\nFriend: im a bit stuck"

Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo.

But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Omgggggggg\\nPersona: \ud83d\udd25\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: What a lovely date \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: I\u2019m so jealous :(\\nPersona: I know\\nFriend: I agree with everything you just said \ud83d\udcaf\\nPersona: Thats great!\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: You know this person?\\nPersona: No. I asked Claudia as well\\nFriend: You follow her\\nPersona: Yeah, like every other person that started following me when I came here\\nFriend: Oh okay\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Miss u guys\\nPersona: Miss u 2\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I have a ticket\\nPersona: I wanna go!!\\nFriend: Just go\\nPersona: I\u2019m trying 2 get some company\\nFriend: Oh okay\\nFriend: But I\u2019m not sure if it will happen this year tho\\nPersona: Why?

So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Miss uuuu\\nPersona: Miss u 2!\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love it\\nFriend: Aaaaah so cute omg!!!!\\nFriend: What happened???\\nPersona: I blackouted and hit my head yesterday\\nFriend: Oh Nikki\\nFriend: Noooo * wtf ahahaha\\nFriend: But is it serious?\\nPersona: It\u2019s okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s really nice\\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them"

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

Apparently I was a menace 4 a solid 10 min before I fell asleep\\nFriend: Hahahah\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately.

We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \".

This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc).

But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: we can investigate if u have time\\nPersona: Cool.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents.

And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind.

I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ok\\nFriend: works now\\nFriend: Did you get the code?\\nPersona: 97191\\nFriend: thanks\\nFriend: here is the cookie\\nPersona: New way?\\nFriend: fuck it does not wotk the pastebin\\nFriend: ok idk the cookie is here\\nFriend: Heyy, should we meet at cbs or online?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gonna be at cbs regardless\\nFriend: Hm\\nFriend: What are we going to talk about?\\nFriend: Cause I am feeling lazy and maybe online meet would do\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0e\\nPersona: Idk, what do u think?\\nFriend: yah you showed me your map on Tuesday\\nFriend: Nah I'll stay home, work at my own, but thanks for the invite.\\nFriend: What I thing we could do:\n1) Like you said, I show you how to fix the green highlightinf\n2) I will show you my own Econ anki cards, which at the time I made were actually really good, as they have graphs and it can help understand the concepts, not the math tho. \n3) We can setup SMS forwarding\\nFriend: And yeah lets postpone it\\nFriend: I am flexible all day today\\nPersona: Sounds gr8\\nPersona: Wanna call at 13?\\nFriend: sure\\nFriend: Can we postpone to 13:30?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: Give me 2 min\\nFriend: alright, no worriies I am also writing an email\\nPersona: Was about 2 send u a link\\nFriend: 60905504\\nFriend: Hey man, can I get the code?\\nFriend: Make me hungy and I'll find a way\\nFriend: I am in\\nFriend: I literally hacked your two factor auth xddd\\nFriend: Their security system is so dumb\\nFriend: without any hacking lol\\nFriend: You'll laugh when I tell you about this\\nFriend: Their security system is literally so flawed. After the exam I think I will message them asking for a bounty.\\nPersona: 73393\\nFriend: no need anymore bro\\nPersona: Wtf hahahah\\nPersona: How did u do this lmao\\nPersona: Plz don\u2019t. Let\u2019s resell all of their content first hahahah\\nFriend: I went to aspiri.dk logged in there, as they don't ask for 2factor, then changed the number for you account. Logged in at play.aspiri, got the code to my phone, then changed the number back to yours.\\nPersona: This text is killing me!\\nFriend: Well I'll ask for a comparable bounty xd\\nFriend: Given that they have just lost 700 kr. becaue of us exploiting it, I would ask for a 10 000kr + bounty\\nFriend: bounty hunting is a real and legit thing if you find exploits\\nFriend: Companies pay for that\\nPersona: Go get them!\ud83e\udee1\\nFriend: Its a low chance this would work, but I could try after the exam\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: We r going 2 the pyramid.

And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind.

Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Oh no\\nPersona: It\u2019s out of our control tho, get well soon!\\nFriend: Thank you\\nFriend: I will try my best\\nFriend: yo how have u been\\nPersona: I'm good thx. writing my mio rn.

But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Don't wake up early for me btw, I might end up taking the bus and coming at 9\\nPersona: Sounds good.

Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree. KMS' r boring for specific organizations, and I would only find it interesting if we could approach it a bit more abstract/theoretical, 2 think of a general purpose (what I think u describe as \"external\"?) approach to knwl mgmt\\nFriend: we modify the code\\nFriend: publicy available knowledge management\\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?
