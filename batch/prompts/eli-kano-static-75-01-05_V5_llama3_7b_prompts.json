It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it.

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone?

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo).

Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents.

But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo).

Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it.

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone?

Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents.

But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone?

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo).

Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents.

But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it.

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone?

Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents.

But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it.

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm"
