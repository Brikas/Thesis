Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what energy are you adding?\\nPersona: chill or high energy?\\nFriend: both\\nFriend: go what you think is nice for night bike\\nFriend: phonk or chill or w/e\\nPersona: Lil peeep xd\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: okay noce\\nPersona: got the vobe\\nPersona: phonk\\nPersona: is\\nPersona: nice\\nFriend: Omw\\nPersona: dude I went all in\\nPersona: I imploded the platylist xdd\\nFriend: Here\\nFriend: Got backpack if u pick up sometginf\\nPersona: Weird, from all that sugar, I am not even hungry in the morning\\nPersona: Searching for that girlfriend be like\\nFriend: im starving \n\nbut then again I didnt have tht much\\nFriend: wtf is girfriend in your closet\\nFriend: you only have dirt\\nPersona: Xdddddddd\\nPersona: she sprouted\\nPersona: I am growing my own\\nPersona: Yeha actually me too, it was just 15 mins after I got up my stomach lied to me, then I turned super hungry\\nPersona: Xddd\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: sounded funny\\nFriend: dvrst - reason to live\nwas so good last night\\nFriend: I know it from before\n\nidk why but it feels a bit nostalgic\\nPersona: Have you applied for housing benefiits?\\nPersona: I just did and I think I'll get 460dkk/mo\\nFriend: No bro\nYou cant\\nFriend: We got shared kitchens\\nFriend: if its the same one we talk about\\nPersona: Some of the ppl from my dorm applied\\nPersona: and they all got it\\nPersona: On my contract it says \"own kitchen\"\\nFriend: Oo shit yea\\nFriend: Thats why you got the sink and frisge space\\nFriend: Smart move\\nPersona: Ye, wish I applied earlier\\nPersona: If I applied since I moved in thats would be like 6k of money\\nPersona: So do you want to come to Talent garden tmmrow to study/work?\\nFriend: I go to work tomorrow\nGotta go to talent on  a free day\\nFriend: Can say i dont go to tbe office some day\\nFriend: Or soon maybe we stop going\\nPersona: Xdddd\\nPersona: gold\\nFriend: Nice!\\nFriend: Getting fired not half bad when you chillin\\nFriend: It says min 2 per group?\\nPersona: yeah, but I am not participating as a competitor\\nPersona: I am going to shoot a video for it\\nPersona: At first I just thought of spectating it, and I will, but also while shooting video\\nPersona: How did they like the candy?\\nPersona: You could actually participate, you are a dev.

Maybe at masters its different\\nPersona: honestly its hard to get over the fact that CBS doesnt approve KEA econ etcs\\nPersona: Ola Puki should do smth about it. He should somehow maybe do a separate exam for econ at KEA\\nPersona: I did econ course three times in my life now, and KEA econ was easier than highschool IB\\nPersona: we got a 10 from micro, but with what I have learned from that I would have prob gotten max a 0\\nPersona: CBS econ was fucking hard\\nPersona: I am.so glad I didnt need to take exam. I felt a bit like cheating.\\nFriend: Cbs pissing me off\n\nThey declined previous applications i had because of english missing\n\nI did ielts and applied.

A yeat ago I even matched all parts and estimated the cost. But I am always reluctant. What I would be happy with is around 7000-8000dkk. Its like equal to one long expensive trip abrouad, or maybe 2 cheaper ones.\\nPersona: But then also by doing that I will ground myself more to nolifer life (lol wtf nice oxymoron), while instead I been trying to go out more.\\nPersona: But then damn, a good pc is like my deepest heart desire and also childhood trauma. Since games good better, I couldnt play any new ones. The last title I could play with maybe 50fps was GTA IV\\nPersona: and that was even laggy\\nPersona: COD MW3 (the old one), Advanced warfare, none ran well. Lowest settings were lagging.\\nPersona: GTA V runs after its been ultra optimized by devs, but low graphics too\\nPersona: Some games like Squad are too laggy to enjoy\\nPersona: Cyberpunk - didnt even dare to try\\nPersona: PCVR prob wont even run\\nPersona: My brother got a decent gaming pc, I remember I was feeling incredible happt seeing high graphics with no lag. It was magical\\nPersona: so yeah\\nPersona: idk, is this happiness worth the risk of falling into nolifer hole\\nPersona: So little of my friends play pc games these days\\nPersona: wtf this is so sad\\nPersona: Life is no longer fun because we have real goals now? wtf\\nPersona: life as a kid was more meaningful\\nPersona: now its a lot of pretending\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: most probably after today's evening you will be able to imagine that <3\\nFriend: 5-6pm at my place?\\nPersona: sounds good, I'll be around 6pm\\nPersona: will do a bit of thesis work\\nPersona: what about snacks and some? we should do some shopping\\nFriend: I bought two packs o chips and drink\\nFriend: You can bring frozen pizzw\\nFriend: Or something proper for eat\\nPersona: pizza is good.

You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: bro I hope you can find a way how to enter cbs for masters\\nPersona: worst case you can take summer course for econ?\\nPersona: or winter course if those exist lol\\nPersona: IS and innovation & entrepreneurship (not sure how called exatcly) masters have pretty nice feedback\\nPersona: I met many people from innovation masters\\nPersona: Not many from IS, but I am considering it myself\\nPersona: But idk, cbs is not nerdy enough for technical courses I feel. Maybe at masters its different\\nPersona: honestly its hard to get over the fact that CBS doesnt approve KEA econ etcs\\nPersona: Ola Puki should do smth about it. He should somehow maybe do a separate exam for econ at KEA\\nPersona: I did econ course three times in my life now, and KEA econ was easier than highschool IB\\nPersona: we got a 10 from micro, but with what I have learned from that I would have prob gotten max a 0\\nPersona: CBS econ was fucking hard\\nPersona: I am.so glad I didnt need to take exam. I felt a bit like cheating.\\nFriend: Cbs pissing me off\n\nThey declined previous applications i had because of english missing\n\nI did ielts and applied. Then econ missing\n\nLast year when i applied figured out the language rules and i didnt have to do english exams. And they said sorry\n\nNow on their website it still says tho KEA students need to fulfil english somehow\\nFriend: I go talk to Ola\\nFriend: He needs to up his game\\nFriend: KEA BEIT has english B and thats enough for the master\\nPersona: yeah, cbs been fucking you over.

A yeat ago I even matched all parts and estimated the cost. But I am always reluctant. What I would be happy with is around 7000-8000dkk. Its like equal to one long expensive trip abrouad, or maybe 2 cheaper ones.\\nPersona: But then also by doing that I will ground myself more to nolifer life (lol wtf nice oxymoron), while instead I been trying to go out more.\\nPersona: But then damn, a good pc is like my deepest heart desire and also childhood trauma. Since games good better, I couldnt play any new ones. The last title I could play with maybe 50fps was GTA IV\\nPersona: and that was even laggy\\nPersona: COD MW3 (the old one), Advanced warfare, none ran well. Lowest settings were lagging.\\nPersona: GTA V runs after its been ultra optimized by devs, but low graphics too\\nPersona: Some games like Squad are too laggy to enjoy\\nPersona: Cyberpunk - didnt even dare to try\\nPersona: PCVR prob wont even run\\nPersona: My brother got a decent gaming pc, I remember I was feeling incredible happt seeing high graphics with no lag. It was magical\\nPersona: so yeah\\nPersona: idk, is this happiness worth the risk of falling into nolifer hole\\nPersona: So little of my friends play pc games these days\\nPersona: wtf this is so sad\\nPersona: Life is no longer fun because we have real goals now? wtf\\nPersona: life as a kid was more meaningful\\nPersona: now its a lot of pretending\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I think amanda has more exposure and she should ask her \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: but I didnt hear anything\\nPersona: it is actually more fun than Cabal or Rimworld?\\nFriend: I get more consumer utility from her\\nFriend: But I'd grind cabal 24/7 if i don't control myself\\nFriend: Also she plays games so one day when things are chiller I'll get the double satisfaction of playing and her\\nFriend: Like i do with you\\nFriend: But i need time to get to that point i think\\nPersona: xddd but the utility curve from girl flattens really fast\\nFriend: Yeah\\nPersona: thats lovely, but girls may suck at games\\nPersona: i played minecraft with my ex\\nFriend: Playing for fun means you are bad\\nFriend: But i have my hopes\\nPersona: that maybe mission impossible\\nFriend: You got the cows inside??

They get a debuff called \"cabin fever\"\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: because they spend too much time inside the base\\nFriend: all those metal stuff. We can get from my village\\nPersona: dude. I think VR is going to bring all of that kinda stuff in seconds in the future\\nPersona: I am waiting for VR to get so advanced we will need so much less resources to satisfy such whims\\nPersona: Like you want a mediaval themed room, you put a setting in VR and you see it\\nFriend: still it would be 'fake' if you know what I mean\n\nI can make a medieval room in sims and that would be enough for me\n\nbut the feeling of decorating and making that yourself is different\\nPersona: yeeeeah I guess\\nPersona: But atleast with my random whims I just can't do everyting\\nFriend: but i think id be satisfied with just a fake visual too\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: you get to change things rapidly at low to no expense\\nFriend: you could have AIs that would decorate the room in some theme\\nFriend: cause every person has a differently sized and set up room so that's where the AI comes in\\nPersona: I am really curious about how extreme sports will carry out\\nPersona: in VR. maybe they'll replace stuff\\nFriend: eh? like which one\\nPersona: I was thinking skydiving. I tried it in VR and real-life\\nPersona: real-life was so much better\\nFriend: oh\\nPersona: but that was 4 years ago\\nFriend: maybe in the sky tube Toby tried\nwith skydive vr\\nPersona: I want to see how much did it improve\\nPersona: Skytube it getting the feeling of the movement :D\\nFriend: and the VR googles would get the visuals too\\nFriend: vr sex suit :D\\nPersona: do you use flux?\\nPersona: yeah that would be sick\\nPersona: jesus :D\\nPersona: I wonder how will that turn out.

Don't think mine does  that\\nPersona: yeah I launched Insurgency and I see it disable\\nFriend: must have some setting. Seems like mine can't disable itself (unless i check any of these)\\nPersona: FB has auto white balance\\nPersona: so look at the wall\\nPersona: the wall changes color\\nPersona: cause my phone adapta from very warm screen to blue\\nFriend: weird\\nPersona: I can see it with eyes, but phone is too slow\\nFriend: I bought Portal 2 during the new year promotions on steam :D i couldn't handle myself. I have a bunch of co-op games in wishlist\n\nwe gotta play\n\nwould be nice if i can get a wide screen from somewhere\n\nor else projector from uni will do\\nPersona: you mean the split screen?\\nFriend: Yes\\nPersona: ok\\nPersona: tmmrow u back?\\nFriend: Yess!\\nFriend: I'm on danish land now\\nPersona: AMAZING\\nPersona: cant wait to meet\\nPersona: but rn I am nolife'ing Rimworld xddd\\nPersona: Dude, did you ever feel love for a game?\\nPersona: But like seriously, deep, true love.\\nFriend: Roller coaster and sandbox m\u00f8des in games have a special place in my heart\\nFriend: Upgrade games too\nCause I don't like losing all my progress when I die\\nPersona: what is roler coaster mode?\\nFriend: no no\n Roller coaster tycoon 2\nIt has a sandbox mode where you can infinitely play\nBuild a theme park\\nFriend: Otherwise you can play \"missions\" where you have to reach certain money or popularity within time limits\\nPersona: ah okay\\nPersona: I think I feel deeply in love with Rimworld.

When I moved in I remember therr was an option but I have no clue who to call\\nPersona: Probably cant do it on Sunday\\nPersona: I did but I still failed somehow\\nPersona: I will try again\\nFriend: So do we play cs go in 2h?\\nPersona: Dude so funny when you message me on steam, I didn't think it was you\\nPersona: I was almost certain it was anna\\nPersona: cause she called me yesterday when I was gaming with my lithuanian friends\\nPersona: and her number was unrecognized\\nPersona: so I ignored it\\nPersona: then she spammed me on msg xd\\nPersona: And today I get a steam message \"hey sweetie\" reply to me on msg\\nPersona: yeah good idea probably\\nPersona: if you live civ and management, strategy games, Rimworld can really suck you in\\nPersona: its so endless its hard to comprehend\\nPersona: I have 600hrs and I still don't know so many things\\nPersona: I play with 100 mods\\nPersona: I can't tell whats a mod and whats official content at this point\\nPersona: Yeah lets play cs2 in 2 hours\\nFriend: Shishhh xd\\nFriend: I will try it when I'm done with thesis\\nPersona: I was showing it to petyo a bit, he played, he liked it as it appears. He wanted to play multiplayer and there is a mod for that\\nPersona: And the mod works great. So perhaps perhaps we may do that three of us\\nFriend: Antoni will play too \ud83d\ude0a\\nPersona: I don't know, I will ask him now\\nFriend: I wrote to him but he is not answering xd\\nFriend: Petyo is joining \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: my cs2 dl is stuck on updating phase\\nFriend: How long to go?\\nFriend: Discord?\\nPersona: okay I fixed it\\nPersona: 5 mins\\nPersona: do I have you on dc?\\nPersona: are you on some channel?\\nPersona: server*\\nFriend: Nah I will just do a call I think\\nPersona: Do you have me?\\nPersona: Mann good game yesterday, unfortunately I now got addicted to cs too xdd\\nPersona: whole day today\\nFriend: really? xddd\\nFriend: was it as fun as yesterday? <3\\nPersona: yeah but I gotta stop gaming\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I tried insurgency sandstorm\\nPersona: Used to play the earlier version a lot\\nFriend: What's that?\\nFriend: Xdddd\\nFriend: Your addiction is back on?\\nPersona: yeeee\\nPersona: one more half hour and I done\\nPersona: dr\\nPersona: a tactical shooter\\nFriend: Similar to r6s?\\nFriend: What about this type of investing?\\nPersona: nah, I would say its inbetween Squad/Arma3 and CSGO\\nPersona: No killfeed, realistic weapon damage and movement, bigger penalties for sprinting\\nPersona: Often you get shot and you never know where from\\nPersona: fragmentation explosions actually work like fragmentation explosions\\nPersona: But the pace is still faster than Squad or Arma3. Much faster\\nPersona: I would say I really recomend it\\nFriend: Sounds good\\nPersona: I woouln't*\\nPersona: I dont recomend it very mcuh xd or maybe thats my impression after trying the new version\\nPersona: it almost feels the same as the old, but for someone who never played, Insurgency might be intereating\\nPersona: and terryfying\\nPersona: like this game is so scary, you are advancing and someone lays down some suppressive fire on you.

You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So when yday me and my gf connected to my VPN, we were able to play on LAN\\nFriend: eh? :DD I didn't know it works like that\\nFriend: we can make a LAN cs game but be in different places?\\nPersona: So this opens up a lot of games multiplayer for cracked games, without actually needing to be on LAN.\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: how much is the vpn?\\nPersona: Instead of needing to host a dedicated server\\nFriend: subscription for cracked games xD\\nPersona: Well Im renting out a virtual private server for ~6$ a month.\\nPersona: 1GB ram, 1000GB bandwidth, I installed Linux\\nFriend: oh but for cs you need good latency\\nPersona: I am in netherlands\\nPersona: the latency is fine\\nPersona: Its basicaly then same as if you were playing CS on a netherlands server\\nPersona: I thik\\nPersona: Or maybe not\\nPersona: yeah its not\\nPersona: its double\\nFriend: why not? this made super sense to me :D\\nFriend: oh\\nPersona: So say you are in DK I am in LT\\nFriend: its cs server -> vpn server -> you\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: not cs server -> you so double\\nFriend: i see now xD\\nPersona: But netherlands is pretty close\\nPersona: Btw, you dont need to buy\\nPersona: You can use mine\\nPersona: I barely use it\\nFriend: after 5 more years when i catch a gf\\nPersona: I made you a profile, but to make what I said work, you may need to give a profile to all of the players, so if you need that hmu, I will give you the pass to webui\\nFriend: we can make a real lan party first :D\\nPersona: :DDDD\\nPersona: yeah I been wanting\\nPersona: for a while\\nPersona: KEA gang is probably more upto that any other gang I know\\nFriend: hows it in CBS\\nPersona: Also, this game Mindustry\\nPersona: is good\\nPersona: Its paid on steam, but its free on itch.io\\nFriend: not many gamers :D ?\\nPersona: just itch.io does not offer seamless multiplayer like Steam offers\\nPersona: So that why we used VPN LAN\\nPersona: Not really\\nPersona: i dont even know\\nFriend: lol wut :D you played that one with Agne?\\nPersona: THe guys I know dont seem to be talking about it\\nPersona: I didn't ask explicitly\\nFriend: making her a nerd or she is one?\\nPersona: Yeah, surprising right? xd\\nPersona: dude xddd\\nPersona: you are reading my mind\\nPersona: I kind of actually have a little though\\nPersona: 'I should make her smarter muhahaha\"\\nPersona: by playing those games\\nPersona: We both played the game for the first time, and not gonna lie, I cought on to the game magnituude times faster and better\\nPersona: But she is a minecraft, csgo, roblox gamer so yee\\nFriend: yeah, youre seasoned in the management genre\\nPersona: When we were at my place, we wanted to dedicate one nigh to gaming, and I saw terraria on her dekstop and I was like, oh this is nerdy enough.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it back a few weeks ago\\nFriend: guess what's the Venn diagram of this and people who've tried wodzionka\\nFriend: but actually it's better that I'd have expected, considering that over 90% is catholic on paper. we're rebels\\nPersona: So we force them to take the wodzionka? How would the ransom note look like?\\nPersona: The infamous shortage was indeed due to my quarterly kong strong procurement round. I suggest you stack up now, cause the my next quarterly round is starting soon.\\nPersona: ok ok, If i too ate wozdzionka I would probably believe in hell, god, 5 second rule,  etc. Clearly explains\\nPersona: Also, would you like to meet this weekend as I am sure our plan to ransom NASA could be discussed in better detail in person? I will make a semi-educated guess there and suggest board games, possibly in a cafe, or maybe a film?\\nFriend: gosh, sorry for that lightning response speed. I've been preoccupied with my studies of wodzionka recipes\\nFriend: no, I've actually been tad busy\\nFriend: oh the idea sounds wonderful, but this is a terrible time. you know, there's a shit ton of work I need to do in the next two weeks, so I'm really tentative with making any definitive plans because I will very likely flake\\nFriend: I haven't quite figured out yet how to make it clear that this is an offer they cannot refuse. do you happen to have some dirt on NASA in your files maybe?\\nFriend: providing you with knowledge on turbo wheelchairs might have been the worst mistake I've ever made then\\nFriend: I almost hate how logical it actually is. because wodzionka was a thing decades ago at the time of food shortages, right? and who believes in heaven, hell and all that? old people\\nPersona: hope its going well with the wodzionka research. vital subject\\nPersona: but I joined your late-response club\\nPersona: Now that I am back to my weekly chilling-at-my-couch-and pretending-I-take-time-to-relax-as-a-normal-person, I can look again into our grand plan\\nPersona: I dont have any particular info to potentially shame NASA, but I think they will be interested in wodzionka powers naturally. Unless of course you know smth yourself, cause its still better to be safe and have smth to press with. Should I write them a proposal?\\nPersona: now with that, watch me sweep Lidl clear of all sugarfree kong strongs, drinks them all in an instant, climb mountain everest, square a circle, solve the halting problem and divide by zero just to be sure\\nPersona: but seriously, I can't last a day at work without consuming that and the drink also makes me feel happy and its cheap\\nPersona: so we are about to make NASA become flat-earth believers?\\nPersona: thats a dissapointment. What are busy with these days?\\nFriend: I can't decide whether I'm more surprised that you are able to fit a couch into your room or that you can chill on it with all that Kong in your system\\nFriend: eh so be it. I suppose if necessary we can always just threaten them with good ol' violence\\nFriend: I don't know, personally I can fall asleep immediately after drinking one but they are cheap indeed\\nFriend: if only we can gain something from it\\nFriend: well, I need to write a thesis\\nPersona: Its a bed that can convert to couch like structure. I would never fit a proper couch, not with my unneccesarily large desk atleast\\nPersona: even with all the kongs I drank, solving halting problem and learning to divide by zero gave me enough existential peace that I can relax anytime\\nPersona: then try the reverse psychology. Drink sleeping pills for energy.\\nPersona: the truth!\\nPersona: do thesis semeter(s) feel more busy than normal?\\nFriend: good for you. you can't run a huge scheme from a small desk\\nFriend: is that why maths people have banned dividing by zero? are they just trying to prevent everybody from having fun?\\nFriend: who said this is the goal. look, with my investment in the coffin I need to get my money's worth\\nFriend: hm I suppose they don't have to, but why play life on the easy mode. with a little bit of procrastination you can easily make them feel very busy very suddenly\\nPersona: yes, cause that would give prople all the answers and therefore stop the infinite existential search for meaning, thus reducing consumption and shrinking the economy\\nPersona: So what do you hold as a proper return on coffeine investment?\\nPersona: Yh, I too seem to choose the hard mode of life. I have a speaking disability, where its hard for me to say 'no'. That really ups the difficulty level\\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\\nFriend: I don't know which group you think I belong to and I can't quite decide which possibility I  find more offensive\\nPersona: wait, so I am not getting my shiny award anymore? \ud83d\ude25\\nPersona: Deal! I wonder what is the exchange rate for crazy pool shots and currency?\\nPersona: So you prefer playing the bad cop then?\\nFriend: not only that. now we're forced to have an awkward 201? Oscars wrong winner moment. you're one slap away from making it into a complete disaster\\nFriend: according to my research, in some recent championship it was 50000$ for a 13-10 score, which leaves as with ~3846$ per a crazy good shot. I can live with that\\nFriend: where's the fun in having a virtuous person as your adversary\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: The indoor plants can survive 2 weeks with no water. Definitely one week\\nPersona: okay so then you are totally fine, cause I will water then thursday (or wednesday) and then its just 4 days\\nFriend: And outside can survive if it rains 1-2 times in the week probably\\nPersona: you guys have so many plants tho like crazy\\nPersona: I have only 1\\nFriend: Haha yeah I know\\nFriend: Well now you got practise for the future lol\\nPersona: plant watering experience\\nPersona: Are you at mociute?\\nFriend: Yeah\\nPersona: okay, nice, if you still see her tonight, say hi to mociute and augis\\nFriend: I will\\nFriend: Think they just went to bed at least the tv is off now\\nPersona: yeah yeah I assumed, then no worries\\nFriend: Tomorrow you can call and congratulate them on 25 year anniversary\u2019s\\nPersona: Augis and Mociute?\\nFriend: Yea\\nPersona: oh wow, I didn't know actually, thanks for letting me know\\nPersona: will call them\\nFriend: No problem. I also didn\u2019t know until few days ago \ud83e\udee3\\nPersona: Its kind of hard to understand how much oil there is\\nPersona: cause once I clean it, put it in, take it out, there is like oil almost in the middle of the stick too, like 5 times above the max level\\nPersona: And there is almost no oil in between the min and max but its so hard to tell\\nPersona: like wtf\\nPersona: the other side had nothing tho\\nPersona: the car is warm, cooleed down 7-10 mins\\nPersona: there is either double too much oil or not enough oil at all\\nFriend: Weird\\nPersona: so should I add a little bit of oil and see what changes on the stick?\\nFriend: Try again maybe it was residue on the sides\\nFriend: But yeah i guess you could do that\\nPersona: I tried over 5 times I think\\nPersona: It does look like residue\\nPersona: If its residue then oil level is very low\\nFriend: Yeah i think its too low most likely\\nPersona: maybe it drags over or smth\\nFriend: This looks more correct\\nPersona: but its way over the limit\\nFriend: Maybe its over\\nFriend: Oil expands when its hot\\nFriend: But i guess you checj with cold engine\\nPersona: I tries cold and warm actually\\nPersona: both were above the max by twice the allowed ranges\\nFriend: Well i guess you need to remove excess oil\\nFriend: Annoying\\nFriend: I thought the mechanic would have checked it before it went to the check\\nFriend: Really weird\\nPersona: okay, but since I am leaving for poland and Helene needs the car, i am giving it to her today, I can remove the excess oil only later\\nFriend: On our car it looks like one side has way too much\\nFriend: While the other looks fine\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: Hey Andreas, on Friday my company is doing a \"MarketRun\". Basically it means that we are meeting the market, talking to friends, family, etc. to get feedback on our product. Would you be up for a meeting some point on Friday? For lunch, coffee or even a beer with me and my colleage Aaron. It should be during working hours so perhaps at your office or your place if you work from home? I wrote to Juste aswell, but we can have separate meetings\\nPersona: Hey, so I forgot to confirm, 10 at your place tommorow for the demo?\\nFriend: Yeah\\nFriend: 10:15\\nFriend: Maybe\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: Is 11:30 okay?\\nPersona: sorry\\nPersona: 10:30\\nPersona: misclick\\nPersona: 10:30***\\nFriend: Thats cool\\nPersona: 10:40, we a bit late\\nPersona: we won the market run\\nFriend: Congrats!

If its free\\nPersona: Andreas missed your call.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: most probably after today's evening you will be able to imagine that <3\\nFriend: 5-6pm at my place?\\nPersona: sounds good, I'll be around 6pm\\nPersona: will do a bit of thesis work\\nPersona: what about snacks and some? we should do some shopping\\nFriend: I bought two packs o chips and drink\\nFriend: You can bring frozen pizzw\\nFriend: Or something proper for eat\\nPersona: pizza is good.

I suppose if necessary we can always just threaten them with good ol' violence\\nFriend: I don't know, personally I can fall asleep immediately after drinking one but they are cheap indeed\\nFriend: if only we can gain something from it\\nFriend: well, I need to write a thesis\\nPersona: Its a bed that can convert to couch like structure. I would never fit a proper couch, not with my unneccesarily large desk atleast\\nPersona: even with all the kongs I drank, solving halting problem and learning to divide by zero gave me enough existential peace that I can relax anytime\\nPersona: then try the reverse psychology. Drink sleeping pills for energy.\\nPersona: the truth!\\nPersona: do thesis semeter(s) feel more busy than normal?\\nFriend: good for you. you can't run a huge scheme from a small desk\\nFriend: is that why maths people have banned dividing by zero? are they just trying to prevent everybody from having fun?\\nFriend: who said this is the goal. look, with my investment in the coffin I need to get my money's worth\\nFriend: hm I suppose they don't have to, but why play life on the easy mode. with a little bit of procrastination you can easily make them feel very busy very suddenly\\nPersona: yes, cause that would give prople all the answers and therefore stop the infinite existential search for meaning, thus reducing consumption and shrinking the economy\\nPersona: So what do you hold as a proper return on coffeine investment?\\nPersona: Yh, I too seem to choose the hard mode of life. I have a speaking disability, where its hard for me to say 'no'. That really ups the difficulty level\\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\\nFriend: I don't know which group you think I belong to and I can't quite decide which possibility I  find more offensive\\nPersona: wait, so I am not getting my shiny award anymore? \ud83d\ude25\\nPersona: Deal! I wonder what is the exchange rate for crazy pool shots and currency?\\nPersona: So you prefer playing the bad cop then?\\nFriend: not only that. now we're forced to have an awkward 201? Oscars wrong winner moment. you're one slap away from making it into a complete disaster\\nFriend: according to my research, in some recent championship it was 50000$ for a 13-10 score, which leaves as with ~3846$ per a crazy good shot. I can live with that\\nFriend: where's the fun in having a virtuous person as your adversary"

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast"

I mean classes don't really touch on them that much\\nPersona: I think I will need to do arbitrage too, production is just slow\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: so you know customer satisfaction is important but how important would it be? How much money should you set aside\n\nSo I want to figure out formulas and ways to test\n\nso you can define your own chart and figure out \n\nif you have 50% margin profit, 10% of it should be for satisfaction\nif you have 60%, 12 for satisfaction \nf.ex.\\nFriend: so I wanna figure out how to find these relationships and make a chart with some actual numbers on it :D\\nPersona: in PrUn?\\nFriend: yeah.

Because it's hard to calculate. We didn't get in depth on that. He said it's things companies keep private anyway. So they figure out peoples inclinations. Those built in us formulas\n\nand then you can plot it and know where your prices can go (when it's about elasticity)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: don't plan on flying anymore for a while. Will just produce for now\\nFriend: and after I've produced enough to sell, I'll go to the exchange again\\nPersona: Thats like 100 - 200 days of OVE xdd\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: even more. My workers use 0.6 a day for now\\nPersona: My consumption in 1/day as I remember\\nFriend: probably because I employ only 120 of them and not 200\\nPersona: Man, yo will have to go to exchange soon anyways\\nFriend: ok so overall consumption is based on employment\\nPersona: and it is not even pricey if you use minimum fuel\\nPersona: Because you need to build more building\\nFriend: how much does fuel cost?\\nPersona: to increase you output level\\nFriend: ye.

I outsource it\\nFriend: outsourcing will be great. But it will take some work on my side\n\nI'll need to see what stage others around me are at and coordinate maybe\\nPersona: oh y\u0119ah you can do that. I think others ir your planet are all food\\nFriend: xD probably\\nFriend: cause it's fertile and has water\\nPersona: its full now\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: if they've designed some of the planets around in such a way on purpose, then trading cross galaxy would be inevitable at some point.\\nFriend: Would be cheaper to buy overalls from your side (if only you have the materials to make it)\ninstead of using the overpriced AI market\\nFriend: not AI\\nFriend: but the game one\\nPersona: yeah true. this will also drive currencies\\nPersona: how much did you pay for single OVE?\\nFriend: overalls? i think price went up to 120 almost after I was done purchasing\\nPersona: I'll come in 1 hour :D\\nPersona: we'll play some PrUs and VR\\nPersona: I did the setup\\nFriend: O ok\nIll shower and go to the store asap then\\nPersona: we can go to the store together\\nPersona: My aunt wanted to try this VR too.

Or build turrets\\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute. If they unfreeeze for a while, say a raid penetrates your base or a unaticipated heatwave heats it up, you will get poluttion in your map and it could be a lot you will need hazmat gear to just survive and clean it up.\\nPersona: you could send the pollutioj away via transport pods to your enemies tho\\nPersona: that will make them real angry and they will send raids to you\\nPersona: there are also sangophuages - pretty much vampires that can live forever but have to drink blood - can be harvested regularly from prisoners\\nPersona: There is also luciferium, a drug I never dares to take. It makea you instantly addicted to it and then if you dont consume it regularly, you will die. However it could overtime heal up otherwise unhealable injury, including permanent ones.\\nPersona: insane\\nFriend: sounds like a good last resort for units that are low\\nFriend: can you not stack it up so you have for that unit for a while_\\nFriend: and are there some ways that unit can be of good value thanks to that unique circumstance?\n\nLike if it will die anyway, good for recon operation maybe or something where death is high chance\n\nor maybe it can pass on knowledge or something\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: You can get a shot in the head and suffer from a permanent brain injury of some type\\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: :)\\nFriend: saturday or whatever day it is ther is ice skating again\\nFriend: i am def going\n\nwas nice learning going backwards last time\\nFriend: and other classmates (Liisa Kuba) are going as well but I'm not in their chat groups so dont know\\nPersona: I may be down too\\nPersona: can you hmu on saturday?\\nFriend: ok\nIll double check if its fri or sat and tell you\\nFriend: did you book for 30th the sauna\\nPersona: Maybe wait\\nFriend: 31st*\\nFriend: its sold out\\nFriend: was empty last week :D\\nPersona: yah and I could not book because page did not work xddd\\nFriend: ahhh\\nPersona: oh well no sauna for me now\\nFriend: I tried named ranges today\\nPersona: Your strategy for job searching is a bit weird tho xdd\nYou look for a full-time job, then once they really like you and want you in you say you can't work full-time and for part-time and if they don't give you - you rejrect xdd\\nFriend: really nice for vlookup\\nPersona: I see that working for a long-term job hunt\\nPersona: But if you need a job faster\\nPersona: maybe not this strategy xd\\nPersona: Nice\\nPersona: I've been into sheets whole day today as well\\nPersona: what are you creating?\\nFriend: in this mmorpg im crafting amulets and rings\n\nfiguring out what would be most beneficial to craft at the moment\\nFriend: want to base it on action house prices\\nPersona: oh xdddd\\nFriend: serves the same purpose like the sheet we had for prun\\nPersona: And then he says he has presentation this week and can't nolife cause no job xdddd\\nFriend: xD\\nPersona: XD\\nFriend: I have a hard time not doing what I want to do\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I am doing my Personal Finance sheet again\\nPersona: pivot tables are lit man\\nFriend: im having a hard time figuring how to make my table..\\nPersona: Its like SQL\\nPersona: I coould help :D\\nFriend: what is this magic you hve\\nPersona: I am doing Google Sheets all day today\\nPersona: do you want to join?\\nFriend: feels like I need some more knowledge that I don't have\\nFriend: don't know where to get it from tho :D\\nPersona: I have some\\nPersona: not all\\nPersona: but I am a big sheets nerd\\nPersona: I am in progress of doing the big Personal Finance sheet\\nPersona: With mobile integration\\nPersona: and its just super complex and automatized\\nFriend: maybe there are some trix I can learn from what youve learned while making it too\\nPersona: ye\\nPersona: do you want to join forces xd\\nPersona: get some good\\nPersona: food\\nPersona: from lidl\\nPersona: and code sheets\\nFriend: yeah that'd be good\n\nfree tomorrow evening? or after tomorrow\\nPersona: today xd?\\nPersona: I am free all the time\\nFriend: bleh im stinky\\nPersona: stinky> xdddd?\\nPersona: what\\nPersona: take a shower and come\\nFriend: i haven't cleaned room or myself for a few days\n\ntoo lazy to prep now\\nFriend: also gotta get up tomorrow cause we present\\nPersona: :DDD idk why but this is hella funny\\nFriend: xDD why\nis it ringing a bell\\nPersona: putting the room cleaning frequency and your body at the same xddd\\nPersona: at the same frequency *\\nPersona: normally\\nPersona: For every 10 showers I clean my room once\\nFriend: xD didn't mean it like that\n\nbut like\nyou eat daily, so you gotta clean daily after yourself\\nFriend: so on my left I've got a sausage, a plastic wrap from cheese\n\nin front an empty ice cream bucket\n\non the right a plate with leftover ribs\\nFriend: to put it in perspective, I gotta get my shit together..

We went to sleep at 12\\nPersona: But it was very fun, we even danced around the christmas tree singing danish songs. That was my first Danish christmas so it was quite a surprise\\nFriend: aw so cute. I don't think I've ever heard about somebody doing that\\nPersona: Hows your today plan looking? You are busy in the evening right?\\nFriend: my guess would be that yes. I'm in cinema and the movie starts now\\nFriend: but it's Avatar so I'll likely be here for a lot of hours\\nPersona: okaaay, so enjoy the movie, I heard good feedback about it\\nPersona: tell me if you liked it after\\nFriend: it was fun! very wholesome. sort of like the intro to Jurassic Park\\nPersona: Would you recomend it?\\nPersona: I watched Gremlins today for first time\\nFriend: if you can stomach the unapologetically clich\u00e9d plot, I think it's nice lightweight entertainment\\nFriend: but let me give you some unsolicited advice: if you're planning to see it, find a place with a big-ass 3d screen, because we went to Empire where they have a standard one, and it didn't really allow for that immersive experience\\nFriend: I had to google. I've never watched it either. my parents never allowed me when they were on TV because my dad was too scared haha\\nFriend: how was that?\\nPersona: Okay, nice unsolitated advice.\\nPersona: So it might be a bit overrated maybe. I heard some people callled it meaningful\\nPersona: I actually didnt know its scary. But its not really scary\\nPersona: I guess scariest was when they put gremlin in the microwave\\nPersona: My aunt said kids were not allowed hahah\\nPersona: many kids*\\nFriend: hm hard to tell. did they elaborate on what they found meaningful?\\nFriend: I can imagine. but think about the long-term benefits - early induction of microwave-related trauma in children must've hurt the microwave industry at least a bit\\nFriend: haha I don't know anymore what was the intended demographic of that movie then\\nPersona: He said not banal, dont remember elaboration\\nPersona: Yeah, maybe they will not have budget for 5 buttons and do onlu 2\\nPersona: very interesting question, cant think of an answer\\nFriend: you know, I think it's safe to expect that whatever was your opinion on the 1st one, you're going to view the 2nd similarly, because the format is more or less maintained\\nFriend: personally both times I approached that as a perceptually rich experience and an ode to the potential of modern technology, but it's not really my place to dispute that meaning found by others\\nPersona: ahh okay, I watched 1st when I was veryyyy young with my friend and his mom. I remember ir being pretty magical, futuristic and my friend moms comment that it was super long\\nPersona: ye ye, but your opinion is nice with that fiction and film experience \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: oooh right, I didn't take that into account. it may be slightly different for you then. you know, I think I was already 11 or something when the 1st one was released so I did register it\\nFriend: thanks \ud83d\ude05 well the more I think about it, the more I can see why for more spiritual or more philosophically Rosseau-leaning people it may be a more profound experience\\nPersona: Its always nice to rewatch movies I watched as super young, see it through adult eyes\\nPersona: Can  you give me a crashcourse on Rosseau philosphy xd?\\nFriend: oh have you had any life-changing rewatch incidents? because honestly I don't really revisit films that often\\nFriend: have you read or watched 'into the wild'?\\nPersona: I once watched film club and shaved my head after xd\\nPersona: I havent but it looks like something I should watch\\nPersona: Maybe I could it even watch it today\\nPersona: actually what about a cozy 2nd day of christmas movie night?\\nPersona: I want to meet with you again before I fall into Susan's trap or die some other death in UK \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: okay, I must say I don't know what I expected to hear, but I surely didn't expect that\\nFriend: I mean it's not really necessary for Rousseau but they are somehow connected in my mind\\nFriend: oh I'm in my mango chutney empire today and tomorrow\\nPersona: fight club is dangerous to watch\\nPersona: hmm maybe I'll watch it today anyways, depends on my mood\\nPersona: and you finish late?\\nFriend: on the other hand, it could've inspired you to do more questionable things, so perhaps it's good it went in that direction\\nFriend: yup, around 10pm\\nPersona: yeaaaaaah, I think so. Did you ever get very affected?\\nPersona: ugh maybe a bit too late, I have work tommorow too \ud83d\ude2a\\nFriend: oh nono, not to that extent. I went to Vienna because of Before Sunrise, and I have a hypothesis that Skins jump-started my teen rebel phase, but that's about it\\nFriend: yeah, that's a bummer \ud83d\ude1e but don't worry, you're about to watch a survival movie. even Susan won't get you now\\nPersona: That actually sounds like bigger and better thing. I guess for me there were more moments where I can see that my decisions were directly influenced by films, but nothing as nice as travelling to another country. But I would like to. I would love to travel to the kind of town in which call me by your name was shot.\\nPersona: although I remembered another moment when I watched too much The Wolf of Wallstreet and tried to give a speech, very similar to the one Jordan gave to his stratonaites, to my Interact club.\\nPersona: Is Skins a tv series or a film?\\nPersona: yee, you convinced me, I am going to watch it and maybe live another year\\nFriend: nooo, yours makes for a better story, and isn't that the best determinant of the quality of the experience? but true, you can't go wrong with a tiny Italian town\\nFriend: what's an Interact club?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: two of the dudes are god damb big\\nPersona: one does for vc and soft funding project as worm\\nPersona: and sent me a list of links for funding\\nPersona: And Lars is just Lars\\nPersona: socially akward in a unique socially akward but charismatic way\\nPersona: and smart af\\nFriend: I need to find the best (and cheapest) way to Klaipeda. Any tips on getting around Lithuania?\n\nI checked the flights and all of them have a transfer in CPH xd (which is not that bad but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the best way). There are direct flights to Vilnius but then it\u2019s difficult to get to Klaipeda\\nFriend: Do you have anything like bla bla car, flixbus etc?\\nFriend: Any hidden means of transport\\nFriend: I\u2019ll have heavy luggage so that makes flying expensive\\nPersona: probably ryanair flight to Kaunas and then train/bus to Klaipeda\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: klaipeda has no aiport\\nPersona: so you either go to vilnius or kaunas\\nPersona: Kaunas is usually cheaper\\nPersona: The train will cost you more than the flight \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: although it seems that its a deal only for those days\\nPersona: You can fly to Palanga actually\\nPersona: Its a new airport\\nPersona: Palanga is very close to Klaipeda\\nPersona: never been to this airport actually\\nPersona: Palanga is a great coastal town itself\\nPersona: full of tourista during summer\\nPersona: And you can get from palanga to klaipeda with a bus very cheap\\nFriend: Yup, sorry. I meant Palanga as it\u2019s nearby\\nFriend: What\u2019s this app?\\nPersona: Kiwi\\nFriend: I\u2019ve been there \ud83d\ude0a but by car, it was much easier hah\\nFriend: Omg perfect\\nPersona: if you go to vilnius, trains ar\u0119 very expensive generally buy they are fast\\nPersona: Okay so just look at the total price and time it will take you.

If you spend a lot of time searching, you might end up getting shit prices as all everything was bought while you were looking.\\nPersona: Seems that after 10 time spent searching, diminishing returns kick in a lot\\nFriend: have you had any lessons on the topic\n\nhowd you get there?\\nFriend: imo great topic\n\nwe do it without thinking twice because there isn't a way to say if it's optimal or not what we do\\nPersona: idk why we had no topic like thst\\nPersona: i just wioke up\\nPersona: fuck i fucked up\\nPersona: i slept the whole day\\nFriend: i figured how to make the calculation btw for going down 2 levels\n\nit depends on whats the cost to get back up to the same level and consider it as if it didnt go down\\nFriend: now a bigger problem. What if it goes up 2 levels instead of 1?\\nPersona: thats also possible?\\nPersona: my project is pretty much almost done\\nPersona: This is regions define\\nPersona: The red area shows how weed and drugs are supplied into the city\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: i tried to verify but i think the prob is my front cam sucks\\nFriend: and it wants you to take a photo of yourseslf\\nFriend: but supposedly this is the reason some brokers won't sell anymore\ncause their clearing house is fucked?\\nFriend: don't know.. need to research more\\nPersona: bought\\nPersona: stocks\\nPersona: for 250eur\\nPersona: 200 GMC , 50 AMC\\nPersona: lol I can help you tmmrow\\nFriend: yeah but my camera is fucked\\nPersona: u can use mine\\nFriend: i need to maybe log in on another phone to take it\\nFriend: but dont know my acc\\nFriend: or pass :D\\nPersona: oh well\\nPersona: so anytime you need my phone hmu\\nFriend: 50 amc o_O\\nPersona: in eur*\\nPersona: the first one\\nPersona: man this guy is a legend\\nPersona: why did thejump happen overnight tho wtf\\nPersona: why did it happen so qucikly in one day even tho he started this so long ago\\nFriend: it actually grew quite a lot the past year \njuly at 4 usd\nnov at 10 usd (thats more than double) \njan at 20\nend of jan at 40\\nFriend: that's 10 times in less than a year\\nPersona: Yeahs thats true\\nFriend: and at some point I assume there are no more low sellers or people see the shit so they don't sell as low anymore\\nFriend: did you see the bid price 200 vs ask price 5000 :D\\nFriend: in certain cases ive seen the price bounce back up at the end of the day\\nFriend: i think there is a chance here the stock bounces down\\nFriend: if people decide to pussy out last moment\\nPersona: :Ddd\\nPersona: its risky business\\nPersona: I am fine loosing it all\\nPersona: but next week\\nPersona: if its hits high I am selling\\nFriend: they say the squeeze would continue for few days so it would be best to sell gradually if everyone were to benefit\\nFriend: if its a coordinated attack\\nFriend: this is baaad\\nFriend: its friday and i'm still playing\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: Leagu\\nPersona: League?\\nFriend: why are you awake too :DD\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: xdd im playing rimworld too\\nFriend: t.t\\nPersona: should we go to sleep?\\nFriend: no way :D\\nFriend: need platinum\\nPersona: lol\\nPersona: is it so hard?\\nPersona: are you a pro?\\nPersona: whats the point?\\nFriend: don't know. it's mental\\nFriend: roughly been around this position\\nFriend: I'm currently at 20% of top \nif I get to plat I'll be 10%\\nPersona: Isn't Leage of Leagends pretty hard?\\nPersona: I mean in Dota 2 I had 600 hrs and I was still pretty not damn good\\nFriend: depends.

A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: in one way\\nPersona: in another way as you say the algirhytm for blending is imcredible\\nFriend: :DD\\nPersona: look at that shit bro\\nPersona: I almost feel stupid\\nPersona: that I like this game\\nPersona: but its so NICE\\nPersona: Its so smooth and its like idk calming like idk\\nFriend: all that gf and game talk is getting me craving\\nFriend: this game would be perfect for casual gaming and chill\\nFriend: yeah calming would be a good way to describe\\nFriend: the time i do art would be a time I could play a game like that\\nPersona: xdd craving for what?\\nPersona: with gf?\\nPersona: yeah like take turns and keep building?\\nPersona: I am planning a port city here\\nPersona: I will also try to tell a story with the city lol\\nPersona: look at that table holy shit\\nFriend: that'd be dope\\nPersona: fuck I got bore\\nPersona: bored\\nFriend: I'm surprised you played that long\\nPersona: xddd\\nFriend: i got a math problem\\nFriend: pls halp\\nPersona: what\\nPersona: is the prob\\nFriend: I assume you udnerstand item upgrades in games? 0 +1 +2 +3 etc\\nPersona: ummm\\nPersona: maybe not?\\nFriend: basically items can be upgraded\n\nbasic item is 0\n\neach grade is reflected in the number\\nFriend: you need specific amount of resources to TRY to upgrade to the next level and have an X amount of chance to succeed or fail\\nFriend: if it was just succeed or fail, it would've been easy\n\nbut the problem comes from % chance to degrade item level if upgrade fails\\nFriend: so level goes 1 down\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: yah I know\\nFriend: so my calculations are getting real messed up now..\n\nat some level the item has a chance to do -2 as well\\nFriend: how do i calculate that shit\\nPersona: Do you have the formula?\\nPersona: or you need empirical research\\nPersona: and then regression fit the model?\\nFriend: no \ni'm trying to make a formula for it\n\nbut based on experience from players, they say the cost to upgrade to +14 that I say is too low\\nPersona: I dont get it\\nPersona: \"they say the cost to upgrade to +14 that I say is too low\"\\nPersona: whats that\\nFriend: that players have upgraded items a lot and have a rough idea in their head how much it should cost\n\nbut they base that on experiene\\nFriend: I want to find out how much it costs mathematically\\nFriend: but our numbers right now differ\n\nI think our numbers would be close together if I have had the correct formula in my calculations how much it should cost\\nPersona: its probabilities\\nPersona: right?\\nPersona: so its like average\\nPersona: Is there a way you can figure out the formula?\\nPersona: Cause empirically testing seems expensive\\nPersona: unless you have a cheap item to upgrade\\nPersona: then just do testing and plot the results and try to fit some curve\\nPersona: I didnt sleep\\nPersona: whole night\\nPersona: I was making a simulation\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: of some stupid thing\\nPersona: Its pretty cool now, I have a bunch of constant set up, in addition to dependent and independent variables, so I can try to adjust the environment and see what happens\\nPersona: Oh and the simulation is basically about imperfect information.\nThere are suppliers who offer same product at varying prices and there are comnsumers who need that product, but they dont know which suppliers are selling in cheapest.\nThey can try to search for the cheapest seller, but there is a risk. While the total supply here is more than total demand, but this is an economy where suppliers dont have infinite stocks individually, thus they can run out of stock. If you spend a lot of time searching, you might end up getting shit prices as all everything was bought while you were looking.\\nPersona: Seems that after 10 time spent searching, diminishing returns kick in a lot\\nFriend: have you had any lessons on the topic\n\nhowd you get there?\\nFriend: imo great topic\n\nwe do it without thinking twice because there isn't a way to say if it's optimal or not what we do\\nPersona: idk why we had no topic like thst\\nPersona: i just wioke up\\nPersona: fuck i fucked up\\nPersona: i slept the whole day\\nFriend: i figured how to make the calculation btw for going down 2 levels\n\nit depends on whats the cost to get back up to the same level and consider it as if it didnt go down\\nFriend: now a bigger problem. What if it goes up 2 levels instead of 1?\\nPersona: thats also possible?\\nPersona: my project is pretty much almost done\\nPersona: This is regions define\\nPersona: The red area shows how weed and drugs are supplied into the city"

You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good?

But he has already tried it earlier at a birthday party and he told me about it.\\nPersona: He is 12 and his friend hosted a birthday party at the \"VR party place\" or whatever, which is where you can rent a VR room with all equipment and program etc.\\nPersona: But he only gave bad reviews about it as there were 7 of them and there was only one VR headset.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Like few cents\\nPersona: I dont think its few cents\\nPersona: I stream 4 hours of Youtube 1080p video and I don't pay a thing to youtube\\nPersona: Youtube allows even 4K streaming for free :DD\\nPersona: I think paying for video resolution quality is really outdated these days\\nPersona: Its like paying for messages sent on a messaging app\\nPersona: just a random remark xdd\\nPersona: By the way I joined Supernova Foundries\\nFriend: Cause it's few cents\nAnd they make it on the ads playing for sure\\nPersona: 10 DKK of few cents haha\\nPersona: Do you actually think they charge more cause of the bandwidth?\\nFriend: But the thing is they don't sell you the traffic but the experience\n\nCinema 140dkk \nDoubt it costs so much to keep it running\nMore about licensing the movie\\nPersona: yeah maybe its licensing\\nPersona: could be\\nPersona: but then the licensing is stupid\\nFriend: No other way to cover costs for a movie that costed 20 millions I guess xD\\nPersona: non HD is so outdated. In fact, if I made a film, I would restrict streaming it non HD\\nPersona: Why deliver a worse UX if the marginal cost is 0.0 from SD to HD\\nPersona: its also bad for the film rating too\\nFriend: Device wise and whatnot\n\nI watch my movies non HD cause they download so much faster but that's torrenting\nI'm sure some have less powerful Internet and need non HD cause HD lags as shit\\nFriend: Gotta remember the shadow economy and how big it is :D\\nFriend: This isn't shadow but my point being people with less resources\\nPersona: Video players, especially the YT one allows tk change quality on the go.\\nFriend: Ah makes sense\\nFriend: Buy the best version and you get all\\nFriend: Then it's just a market trick attempt maybe\\nFriend: Markrting*\\nPersona: yeah maybe its a trick\\nPersona: so they can say \"its only 29 DKK\"\\nFriend: With a little star\\nPersona: while with this price it will look trash on your 35\" TV\\nFriend: Or \"starting from\"\\nPersona: my rant is over\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: the gamer chairs are so god damn good\\nFriend: Jysk?\\nFriend: It was really funny to me when I went to Bulgaria last year and see a gaming chair in my mums home office\\nFriend: But she sits a lot and it's so comfortable\\nPersona: i think i will get one xd\\nPersona: such a nice UX drawer\\nFriend: But why\\nPersona: when you are looking for stuff\\nPersona: ex\\nPersona: ez\\nPersona: fuck the gaming\\nPersona: chair\\nPersona: I am taking this\\nFriend: How much is that\\nFriend: Would be amazing to have one on the terrace\\nPersona: 1500\\nFriend: A lot\\nPersona: maybe\\nPersona: not too much\\nPersona: Sunday\\nPersona: You, me  Zoe\\nPersona: ?\\nPersona: at ur place\\nPersona: or maybe we can also invite her to Justes\\nPersona: yeah shes cooming on saturday\\nPersona: my worst nightmare\\nFriend: I still don't get it \nis it breaking\\nFriend: no sound coming out\\nFriend: wait\ndo we go to my place witH zoe\\nFriend: Zoe\\nPersona: no its red\\nPersona: so its empty baterry\\nPersona: to justes\\nFriend: ... xD charge?\\nFriend: ah ok\\nFriend: cause if we do my place, I was gonna offer inviting Vin\\nFriend: so we can be 4 ppl 2 v\\nFriend: vr\\nPersona: yr i know xdd\\nPersona: I will go to Justes place on saturday anyway as it was her birthday\\nFriend: Ah Saturday or Sunday you talk about Zoe"

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what is rhis?\\nFriend: Controllers\n2 ppl\nDungeons\nSlash kitties\\nFriend: Upgrade skills\\nFriend: Its not that hard tho\\nFriend: Simple control\\nFriend: Idk if i vcan run it\\nPersona: 2 step verification should be from mobile, no?\\nFriend: Ormail\nI try notto enter phone when i can\\nPersona: cat quest sounds good as well. Rimworld is definetely superior option, but if it doesnt work xT game could be nice\\nPersona: Cat* (not xT)\\nPersona: But not at my place, I left a big mess before travel and I am too lazy to move anything\\nPersona: I can come to you, just baught snacks\\nPersona: We can also watch the film \"Downfall\"\\nPersona: I want to watch after auschwitz\\nFriend: A little mess here too but livable if you want\\nFriend: In foetex atm\\nFriend: Home\\nFriend: Shower and stuff\nReaddy if you qant to come in 30+\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: need to get over my laziness\\nFriend: Take your time\nI have postknight 2 on phone xD\nGood game\\nPersona: Yo man, I realized I am.not just lazy I havent slept much\\nPersona: maybe lets do it tommorow\\nPersona: I will.nap\\nFriend: Ah alright\\nFriend: Take care\\nFriend: I'll catch you tomorrow maybe then\\nPersona: bruh real life is intruding into my nolife at this point\\nPersona: this polish chich I dated/slept at in Poland now wants to play pc games with me\\nFriend: Big win\\nPersona: idk man, i wonder how will she enjoy rimworld\\nFriend: Good test\\nFriend: Maybe she does\\nPersona: do you know about banano?\\nPersona: Spent half say trying to fix corrupted windows only to give up and do a reinnstall\\nPersona: I also backuped whole appdata folder just because\\nPersona: it took a while even with robocopy. Maybe that will avoid me making some settings in apps\\nPersona: I am.more and more convincing myself to build a powerful gaming pc. But thats equivalent to 1.5 - 2 trips abroad\\nFriend: NOT A SHITCOIN (UNTIL DIGESTED)\n\nI like it already\\nPersona: xddd\\nFriend: Saw this on my phone and thought you got scared of spilling water\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: No no, I managed to get my windows broken\\nPersona: software issue only\\nPersona: (I think)\\nPersona: But who knows, maybe SSD is bad, although would be super weird given its youth. Or CPU is so old its firing wrong bits\\nFriend: Did app data and files recovered gotyou back browser passwords\\nPersona: I use Bitwarden, so they are encrypted on the cloud\\nPersona: Its mainly for app settings, various game savefiles, vs code extensions, settings\\nFriend: Awh ok :(\\nPersona: But why u ask?\\nPersona: U use chrome passwords?\\nFriend: And mozilla\\nFriend: But thats local i think\\nFriend: Not sure i have acc\\nFriend: Also have some passwords on a mindmap\\nPersona: I was always sceptical about those default solutions\\nPersona: 1password is good, but its paid. Bitwarden has a nice free plan, been using it for more than a year\\nPersona: Works on phone apps too\\nFriend: Was thinking of moving to a more flexible solution than browser\n\nWill try\\nPersona: bruh\\nPersona: the second part of the para\\nFriend: They own/pay mozilla just to stay outta trouble?\\nFriend: Wild\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: Clean start\\nFriend: You can become anyone\nDo anything\\nPersona: Like always xddd\\nPersona: Edge trying to survive\\nFriend: LooooL\\nFriend: If it didn't have fucky defaults i would stay\\nFriend: It's just as good as other broswers\\nPersona: They really want me to use Efge xdd\\nPersona: My literral plan this weekend: Eat, play rimworld, sleep, repeat\\nPersona: I am setting up a whole medieval rimworld playthrough\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So when yday me and my gf connected to my VPN, we were able to play on LAN\\nFriend: eh? :DD I didn't know it works like that\\nFriend: we can make a LAN cs game but be in different places?\\nPersona: So this opens up a lot of games multiplayer for cracked games, without actually needing to be on LAN.\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: how much is the vpn?\\nPersona: Instead of needing to host a dedicated server\\nFriend: subscription for cracked games xD\\nPersona: Well Im renting out a virtual private server for ~6$ a month.\\nPersona: 1GB ram, 1000GB bandwidth, I installed Linux\\nFriend: oh but for cs you need good latency\\nPersona: I am in netherlands\\nPersona: the latency is fine\\nPersona: Its basicaly then same as if you were playing CS on a netherlands server\\nPersona: I thik\\nPersona: Or maybe not\\nPersona: yeah its not\\nPersona: its double\\nFriend: why not? this made super sense to me :D\\nFriend: oh\\nPersona: So say you are in DK I am in LT\\nFriend: its cs server -> vpn server -> you\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: not cs server -> you so double\\nFriend: i see now xD\\nPersona: But netherlands is pretty close\\nPersona: Btw, you dont need to buy\\nPersona: You can use mine\\nPersona: I barely use it\\nFriend: after 5 more years when i catch a gf\\nPersona: I made you a profile, but to make what I said work, you may need to give a profile to all of the players, so if you need that hmu, I will give you the pass to webui\\nFriend: we can make a real lan party first :D\\nPersona: :DDDD\\nPersona: yeah I been wanting\\nPersona: for a while\\nPersona: KEA gang is probably more upto that any other gang I know\\nFriend: hows it in CBS\\nPersona: Also, this game Mindustry\\nPersona: is good\\nPersona: Its paid on steam, but its free on itch.io\\nFriend: not many gamers :D ?\\nPersona: just itch.io does not offer seamless multiplayer like Steam offers\\nPersona: So that why we used VPN LAN\\nPersona: Not really\\nPersona: i dont even know\\nFriend: lol wut :D you played that one with Agne?\\nPersona: THe guys I know dont seem to be talking about it\\nPersona: I didn't ask explicitly\\nFriend: making her a nerd or she is one?\\nPersona: Yeah, surprising right? xd\\nPersona: dude xddd\\nPersona: you are reading my mind\\nPersona: I kind of actually have a little though\\nPersona: 'I should make her smarter muhahaha\"\\nPersona: by playing those games\\nPersona: We both played the game for the first time, and not gonna lie, I cought on to the game magnituude times faster and better\\nPersona: But she is a minecraft, csgo, roblox gamer so yee\\nFriend: yeah, youre seasoned in the management genre\\nPersona: When we were at my place, we wanted to dedicate one nigh to gaming, and I saw terraria on her dekstop and I was like, oh this is nerdy enough.

Or maybe tmmrow\\nPersona: Both good for me\\nPersona: I want to do one thing xdd Its going to sound quite weird\\nPersona: But I want to play one singleplayer game together\\nPersona: By just starting to play it at the same time\\nPersona: And the game may surprise you idk :DDD\\nPersona: maybe not\\nFriend: I woudl be surprised if itd not Rimworld\\nPersona: its not rimworld\\nPersona: you would never guess it\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast"

Maybe at masters its different\\nPersona: honestly its hard to get over the fact that CBS doesnt approve KEA econ etcs\\nPersona: Ola Puki should do smth about it. He should somehow maybe do a separate exam for econ at KEA\\nPersona: I did econ course three times in my life now, and KEA econ was easier than highschool IB\\nPersona: we got a 10 from micro, but with what I have learned from that I would have prob gotten max a 0\\nPersona: CBS econ was fucking hard\\nPersona: I am.so glad I didnt need to take exam. I felt a bit like cheating.\\nFriend: Cbs pissing me off\n\nThey declined previous applications i had because of english missing\n\nI did ielts and applied. Then econ missing\n\nLast year when i applied figured out the language rules and i didnt have to do english exams. And they said sorry\n\nNow on their website it still says tho KEA students need to fulfil english somehow\\nFriend: I go talk to Ola\\nFriend: He needs to up his game\\nFriend: KEA BEIT has english B and thats enough for the master\\nPersona: yeah, cbs been fucking you over. I guess they have so many applicant that their mistakes dont cost them much\\nPersona: tell me more\\nFriend: Lets go?:D\\nPersona: thats interesting\\nPersona: Ever been to silent disco?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: First time\\nPersona: I am in, should I buy the ticket?\\nFriend: Yeah\nI'll getone today\\nPersona: Yo, you want to join Presidents Summit?\\nFriend: When what maybe\\nPersona: Wednessday\\nPersona: as a volunteer\\nPersona: we still need ~15 volunteers\\nPersona: There are loads of new VR games. Do you want to make a VR night some time after exams?\\nPersona: Do you go to Bulgaria?\\nFriend: vr night :O mine isn't set up\\nFriend: I might have to go for a day or two\n\nOtherwise for vacation i'll go maybe august\\nPersona: We do it later, so you plenty of time to setup\\nPersona: I just downloaded 10+ vr games to my flash drive\\nPersona: but if you dont mind waiting the slow download speeds you can dl yourself\\nPersona: there is a website linked in r/questpiracy\\nPersona: rookie sideloader\\nPersona: just for a day or two? how cheap are the tickets?\\nFriend: eh 800 both ways is normal price\\nFriend: can go higher\nsometimes lower\\nFriend: what are you up to?\nYou wanna join me?\\nFriend: yeah if parents wanna buy an apartment i might need to go sign and help buy it\\nPersona: Oh, you need to sign\\nPersona: I was just asking to know if you are available in June\\nPersona: Me and a couple of other ppl from cbs were thinking to do a trip to Bulgaria actually, I will let you know whats happening and you should join us if we go, but not planning rn, cause so many exams\\nFriend: If hiking, im in!!\\nPersona: hiking? What are the options 4 that?\\nFriend: \u0427\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0435\n\u0421\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0442\u0435 \u0420\u0438\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430\n\u0414\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0430\\nFriend: Movie today?\\nPersona: exam bro, exams\\nPersona: we have 5 exams\\nPersona: 2 done, 3 left\\nPersona: group hand in on thursday\\nFriend: x___x\\nFriend: gl\\nPersona: Man, from time to time I keep thinking to myself that I should build a proper gaming pc. A yeat ago I even matched all parts and estimated the cost. But I am always reluctant. What I would be happy with is around 7000-8000dkk. Its like equal to one long expensive trip abrouad, or maybe 2 cheaper ones.\\nPersona: But then also by doing that I will ground myself more to nolifer life (lol wtf nice oxymoron), while instead I been trying to go out more.\\nPersona: But then damn, a good pc is like my deepest heart desire and also childhood trauma. Since games good better, I couldnt play any new ones. The last title I could play with maybe 50fps was GTA IV\\nPersona: and that was even laggy\\nPersona: COD MW3 (the old one), Advanced warfare, none ran well. Lowest settings were lagging.\\nPersona: GTA V runs after its been ultra optimized by devs, but low graphics too\\nPersona: Some games like Squad are too laggy to enjoy\\nPersona: Cyberpunk - didnt even dare to try\\nPersona: PCVR prob wont even run\\nPersona: My brother got a decent gaming pc, I remember I was feeling incredible happt seeing high graphics with no lag. It was magical\\nPersona: so yeah\\nPersona: idk, is this happiness worth the risk of falling into nolifer hole\\nPersona: So little of my friends play pc games these days\\nPersona: wtf this is so sad\\nPersona: Life is no longer fun because we have real goals now? wtf\\nPersona: life as a kid was more meaningful\\nPersona: now its a lot of pretending\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: u in bulgaria\\nFriend: we can find a way with technology :D\\nPersona: we can watch it in VR\\nFriend: i don;t know how\nand internet here wouldn't be reliable to get us to watch together like that i think\\nFriend: i was thinking of downloading and playing same time\\nPersona: We can do that on VR\\nPersona: and it will also by synced\\nPersona: and we will see each other\\nPersona: its also free\\nFriend: what program should i get\\nFriend: can we test on a small vid/movie\\nFriend: We will figure something out :D\\nPersona: I think its Big Screens\\nPersona: or smth\\nPersona: its free\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: so where we watch?

Haven't reached that far yet tho\\nPersona: its in fortnite?\\nFriend: Yeah\nGamemod\nUses their game engine somehow\\nFriend: forget about reading differently data and data\\nFriend: how do you read vitamin?\\nPersona: bro\\nPersona: i nolifed hard\\nPersona: got a bit sick\\nPersona: so thought I will play for a bit\\nPersona: but\\nPersona: ended up playing till 8 in the morning until I just collapsed and could not properly play anymore\\nPersona: I played Rimworld with all dlc and lots of mods\\nPersona: its infinetely interesring\\nPersona: I cant comprehend the scale of it...\\nFriend: i kinda wanna see what's that about\\nPersona: Rimworld?\\nPersona: You played it a bit remember?\\nFriend: yeah but you go hardcore and mods and maybe have big base\\nPersona: yeah thats is cool, I built a pretty good base this time, and its the first time I played with vehicles, so I also made roads inside my \"village\" for them to pass\\nFriend: it's not like the age of empires car, is it xd\\nPersona: I made a tier 1 tank, which was pretty shit, but then the infantry tranport truck that has a mounter low caliber weapon was prretty good\\nPersona: so I kept raiding a few enemy bases with it\\nPersona: ahaha no xd\\nPersona: the vehicle mod is really advanced there\\nPersona: Its as sophisticated as each person\\nPersona: vehicles can hold people, cargo, need gas. Has as many body parts as a human pretty much with each taking damage separately and impacting the performance of it\\nFriend: holy shit xD that's rimworld or realworld\\nPersona: I also never properly done things with Biotech dlc, its official content so high quolity\\nPersona: it allows gene engineerging, mechanoid building\\nPersona: babies\\nPersona: well I had babies inevitably\\nPersona: but never went into advanced mode with them\\nPersona: there are growrh capsules to speed their growing\\nPersona: As they grow you are able to partially influence their traits, passions\\nPersona: and it you got gene engineering tech, you could gene engineer them to be extra adapted to your environment\\nPersona: then there is also Ideologies. I always play classic style idealogies, but you can get a whole new game if you build, evolve or changr to a different one\\nPersona: f.e. you could be cannibbal slaver\\nPersona: that requires you to have slaves, do executions and consume human meat\\nPersona: (required as in peope will be unhappy and have mental breaks)\\nFriend: oh yeah you said there is canibalism\n\nbut what if you can't find other  people to eat, do you have to make babies and eat your own ppl\\nPersona: you would also be benefitted from having blood, skulls visible everywhere\\nPersona: xdd, I think you can still eat other food in a pinch\\nFriend: ah\\nPersona: but you can raid other bases\\nFriend: eww.. food xD\\nPersona: and eat them\\nPersona: lol\\nPersona: but canibalistic meme is just one of many\\nPersona: there is like a meme (ideology trait) that says blindness is sacred\\nPersona: so basically you fo ceremononies whete you remove eyes of your own colonists\\nPersona: and then everyone lives blind\\nPersona: so you would have to resort to melee combat, animal etc to fight for you I guess. Or build turrets\\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute. If they unfreeeze for a while, say a raid penetrates your base or a unaticipated heatwave heats it up, you will get poluttion in your map and it could be a lot you will need hazmat gear to just survive and clean it up.\\nPersona: you could send the pollutioj away via transport pods to your enemies tho\\nPersona: that will make them real angry and they will send raids to you\\nPersona: there are also sangophuages - pretty much vampires that can live forever but have to drink blood - can be harvested regularly from prisoners\\nPersona: There is also luciferium, a drug I never dares to take. It makea you instantly addicted to it and then if you dont consume it regularly, you will die. However it could overtime heal up otherwise unhealable injury, including permanent ones.\\nPersona: insane\\nFriend: sounds like a good last resort for units that are low\\nFriend: can you not stack it up so you have for that unit for a while_\\nFriend: and are there some ways that unit can be of good value thanks to that unique circumstance?\n\nLike if it will die anyway, good for recon operation maybe or something where death is high chance\n\nor maybe it can pass on knowledge or something\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: You can get a shot in the head and suffer from a permanent brain injury of some type\\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail"

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method?

I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself.

Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What's your plan for today?\\nPersona: Game until maybe 19:00 then stop and try really hard to resist further play\\nFriend: Why?

I don't mean it in a bad way. It's just that most people who study movies, music etc often can no longer enjoy it in the free time\\nFriend: Any recommendations on recent movies?\\nPersona: I never was forced to study them and I don't deliberately study them, I just enjoy it\\nPersona: For a film to be good it has to be enjoyable in my opinion\\nFriend: Woow, even better\\nPersona: But I like when the film makes me feel something interesting\\nFriend: Will try to get a discount ;))\\nPersona: let me check too\\nFriend: Totally agree!\\nPersona: Okay, you have a lot of time to find a discount for me, I don't have even medium money now haha\\nFriend: I used to study videography in middle school.

I think other people enjoyed it more than me.\\nPersona: damn\\nFriend: Oki, will save this one too\\nPersona: If I feel that, then I say its a bad movie\\nPersona: Okay, sometimes, you have to sit through the first 15 mins, as if it was an investment into a great movie\\nPersona: but then if I feel bored at first 15 mins, I would rate the movie max 9/10.\\nPersona: Top Gun: Maverick (2022). Cliche but it made me feel really happy and thrilled.\\nFriend: Do you know C'mon C'mon?\\nPersona: Get Out (I) (2017) (horror). Real nice horror film\\nPersona: neverseen\\nPersona: Should I?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: ye I've read that before, its good\\nFriend: i am trying to figure out who those people in the video are\\nFriend: do you know if it is right that they are local business people who pose in the campaign for BP\\nFriend: or do they have more involvement with BP than that\\nPersona: They said that they are the employees of BP I think\\nFriend: i think i figured it out. In the video one of them is a BP representitive and the two others are people in the local business\\nPersona: This Iris Crosss woman is apparently a big part of their new compaign\\nPersona: idk if she is in the actual ad\\nFriend: she is\\nFriend: she\u2019s the blonde\\nPersona: but she is not blond xd\\nPersona: but maybe she colored her hair\\nFriend: probably\\nFriend: do you know when the schrimp as was released?\\nPersona: they say it in that press release\\nPersona: They say it will debut and they give a date\\nPersona: I think its 26th\\nFriend: yeah they say the initial advertisement in the campaign will be released in december 2011\\nPersona: The initial advertisement in the series, which will debut on December 26, 2011,\\nFriend: but i dont think this is the initial\\nPersona: Oh\\nPersona: fuck\\nPersona: Thats the problem with TV ads\\nPersona: you can not have a complete overview\\nFriend: there are many if you search voices of the gulf\\nPersona: I havent analyzed that one yet\\nPersona: So basically we dont have to take the very first then\\nPersona: Find one you think is the most 'median' and lets take that\\nFriend: i guess they are all released around 2011-2012 but i cant really find much proof for when the schrimp one was released\\nFriend: maybe it doesent matter\\nFriend: we know the campaign started airing in end of 2011\\nPersona: They are mostly early 2012 I would say\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: cause the campaign was annouced on 2022-12-22\\nPersona: ye\\nPersona: So if you can, watch over a few ones and pick something that fits most of the themes that all of them contain (seafood, tourism, fisherman, wildlife (if any))\\nFriend: we can just use the one we picked bc its the same for all of them\\nPersona: Cause if we pick only one, we risk of picking the worst one or the best one, which would make our project very subjective\\nPersona: so the only one that we pick must be like the average\\nFriend: so you think we should pick more than one?\\nPersona: Right, but can you find the date? Or we dont need the date?\\nPersona: No no, I am saying that its fine we pick one ass long as it contains all of the topics and themes\\nFriend: its all the same shit\\nPersona: then its good\\nPersona: omg its so funny\\nPersona: POV: a car pulls over near you and this what the driver does\\nFriend: i mean for this commercial the only different thing is that the youtube channel it is published on is BPs which makes it easier to say they are the sender but idk we know they are anyways\\nFriend: hahahahah\\nFriend: jesus\\nFriend: they say exactly the same thing in all of them\\nFriend: they could have been a bit more creative\\nPersona: yeah they are cause of the ending screen and you cana argue with the ending screen if needed\\nFriend: ookay actually lets take the last one i send if thats ok\\nFriend: they say the tag line \"100% open for business\" which i dont think they ahve in the first one\\nFriend: and thats pretty good\\nPersona: poor father\\nPersona: Okay\\nFriend: omg its actually so sad\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: idk if thats true what they are saying\\nFriend: hahah\\nPersona: You would need some quantitative analysis to really understand the majority\\nFriend: BP could never win\\nFriend: majority of what?\\nPersona: yeah its a pretty shitty situation they are in\\nPersona: Like whats the majority opinion on the actual gulf heatlh\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Idk if this is important, but I dont mention it.

You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Xdddd\\nPersona: gta 6 treiler got 100m views in one day\\nPersona: the only thing that could break thaat is probably an official HL3 trailer\\nFriend: But stocks still went down \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: weird\\nPersona: by how muuch\\nFriend: just a bit\\nFriend: but they went down beacuse release date is 2025\\nFriend: and investors expected 2024\\nFriend: Patryk called you.\\nPersona: you dont need to\\nFriend: How exam goes?\\nPersona: done\\nFriend: What plans for today evening?\\nPersona: hello\\nPersona: Anna is now at a dinner with her organization, she will maybe free up before 20\\nPersona: and then no plans\\nPersona: I am free from noe\\nPersona: I was trying to get in touch with petyo\\nPersona: but either exam or gf is taking all his attention haha\\nPersona: actually I would be down\\nPersona: What time?\\nPersona: take a shower at my place, we will be alone \ud83d\ude18\\nPersona: I'll ask what is Annas agenda\\nPersona: but you can visit be probably at 18:30 regardless I just dont know when I will have to pick her up\\nPersona: It would be lovely to get some ramen\\nPersona: In the city tho\\nPersona: in village they only have kebab\\nPersona: pho\\nPersona: maybe pho\\nPersona: burger is nice too\\nPersona: STEAK\\nPersona: im in\\nPersona: get some steaks on the way\\nPersona: we cooking \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: sounds good too\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Here\\nFriend: I'm famous!\\nFriend: Gonna see you tomorrow at SAP?\\nPersona: wait a bit, I forgot, I tell you in a bit\\nPersona: Petyo wants to have a little gathering for a birthday at my dorm in the cinema room\\nPersona: and he only can tommorow\\nPersona: So I gotta change plans\\nPersona: do you want to join?

From technicalities, to the boldness and richness of the plot.\\nPersona: Triangle of Sadness\\nPersona: Its beauty, money and society challenged all in different ways, while at the same time.\\nPersona: You don't even need to analyze it. It comes straight at you.\\nPersona: I don't know if its very Kaja-safe\\nPersona: more safe than the other one. Maybe even safe if you consider the plot includes the three concepts put into very extreme situations.\\nPersona: I would like to discuss a few scenes from it with you\\nPersona: if u watch it soemtime\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: I will ask you more about it, a bit omw now \ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: REMEMBER WE ARE GOING OUT FOR A PUB QUIZ ON FRIDAY\\nPersona: OKAY I WILL REMEMBER THAT\\nPersona: Do I have to buy ticket?\\nFriend: GREAT\\nFriend: I bought tickets already\\nFriend: so you just have to come, and use 100% of your brain to help us win pub quizes\\nPersona: My brain is sucessfully reserved then.

I made the total demand and it works. Adjust to elasticity and looks like it makes sense\\nPersona: one thing tho is that I think I should declare elasticity for individually each consumer. As it does differ a bit I guess.\\nPersona: Since for some it may be more and for some it may be less of a necessity. Also for some it maybe of bigger proportion of income and for some it maybe not.\\nPersona: omg JS is god\\nPersona: Like its so easy to experiment by just running commands in the console\\nPersona: Quality in this current version has some real diminishing marginal returns\\nPersona: There is so much improvement from 1 - 2, but so little from 7 - 9\\nPersona: And this is for elasticity\\nPersona: There are two very unrealistic assumption tho:\nPeople will only buy as much as they need. This is why the button part does not concave, while the top does.\\nPersona: Everytime I refrech I get new personalities :D\\nPersona: The previous was only with 10 ppl\\nPersona: this is 50 people\\nPersona: This is 500\\nPersona: Each time the personalities are random and at 10 consumers, the demand curve is quite different on each refresh\\nPersona: at 500 its almost always the same\\nPersona: Yo do you want to start learning math?\\nPersona: we can find a few book and strat learning\\nPersona: Because I think I will do that\\nFriend: Math is nice\nSure\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: didnt have katofelbrod\\nPersona: got some other white big brod\\nFriend: Ok :D\nWh it e is good\\nPersona: im just below\\nPersona: Wannna try this?\\nPersona: I am def registering man\\nFriend: I'm in\\nFriend: 5 floors far\\nPersona: I am starting too now\\nPersona: have u already started? :ooo\\nFriend: just now :D\\nFriend: watching transmisions to figure out how tings work\\nPersona: im thinking of comapny name xddd\\nFriend: the fuck is this\n\nso complex\\nPersona: yeeeee\\nPersona: jesus\\nFriend: .. this game is perfect for you :D\\nPersona: is there a tutotrial?\\nFriend: yea\nso when you get in\ntop right there is NOTS\\nFriend: notifications i guess\\nPersona: i found\\nPersona: ye\\nPersona: wtf a command line?\\nPersona: omfg\\nPersona: this got income statements and shit\\nFriend: xD\\nFriend: I can't figure out if my planet has commodity exchange\\nFriend: fuck it.. ill pick it anyway\\nFriend: whats your nickname\\nPersona: xdddd\\nPersona: oh no\\nPersona: brikas\\nFriend: Stef is getting the quest 2 probably too\\nPersona: amazing\\nFriend: oo\nI gotta apply for jobs\n\nmaybe tomorrow evening or day after tomorrow\\nFriend: I'll have to do 20 applications\n\nill be ded\\nFriend: send BSE pls\\nPersona: xdd\\nFriend: can't mine for water without it\\nPersona: where are you?\\nPersona: I  m still figuring wtf I am doing\\nPersona: Oh yeah man\\nFriend: DEIMOS PLI ZV-759c\\nPersona: you gotta send 20\\nPersona: or you pay to charity\\nFriend: fuuuck :D\\nFriend: game on!\\nFriend: I'm starting from now\\nFriend: because I don't like half-assing my applications\\nFriend: and it takes me like an hour every time I apply\\nPersona: Good luck man\\nPersona: you have a lot of work\\nFriend: Does my looking into CodersTrust count for a job application\\nPersona: When you send the your cv yeah\\nFriend: I gave it to Heidi"

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: From wiki\n\nThe maximum level of XP that players can get legitimately is 238,609,312, and at this level the experience bar disappears, because reaching the next level would require more XP than the 32-bit integer limit (2,147,483,647, which is 231 - 1).\\nFriend: So if it works \nIn 1 month time if the server hasnt exploded from the farm, it will explore from me having too much\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: xp is nice\\nPersona: if u have iron farm, sugarcane farm and cow farm in addition to op Xp farm, you can become the enchantment lord\\nPersona: but in dar 4 I cant really do much\\nPersona: Looking to play this durinng holiday\\nPersona: bruh I skipped school today\\nPersona: cause of gaming\\nPersona: Idk what to do xd\\nPersona: I just cant control.my mind and curiociry\\nFriend: pension would be a sweet time\\nFriend: no life all day\n\ntaking care of some plants\\nFriend: eating some sweet ass garlic breads\\nPersona: I see pixelmon is very popular but idk if its my type\\nPersona: yeeee\\nPersona: hopefully when we are in pesion gaming is 10x good\\nPersona: mate, do you still have the xbox controllers we used to play with on PC via TV screen?\\nFriend: They are PS tho\\nPersona: but they work with PC?

I didnt see it as that until you said\\nPersona: was it a very famous painting?\\nFriend: Nope\\nFriend: And even if it was, it's not his job to know what xd\\nPersona: yup agree\\nPersona: ok imma get back to work\\nPersona: today was crazy, I feel like I work for 2 hours and actually whole 8 hours passes\\nPersona: And thats after just being distracted by gaming. My mind switched to work in like split second.\\nPersona: never happened before\\nFriend: Aww that's awesome! Happy to hear that\\nFriend: Any plans for the evening?\\nFriend: I'm meeting with my dad so I'll text you later \ud83d\ude0c\\nPersona: Unfortunatelly, I decided to game one more day\\nPersona: \"one more day\"\\nFriend: Any time limit? Can I join you later?\\nPersona: \"One more day\" is super risky. But I am a risk taker\\nPersona: thats the stupidest thing I said\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yupp we have to plan it better, I hoped it will somehow manage itself and didn't put enough attention to this plan\\nFriend: and that killed this idea\\nFriend: Xddd\\nFriend: Hi man, any plans for tomorrow?\\nPersona: Hey hey, back to DK? \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: No big plans tomorow\\nFriend: YUPPP <3\\nFriend: What would you say for trip to Vejby\\nPersona: yeeee\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: Whats the plan?\\nFriend: Chillin in my convertible, Dippin balls in baltic, sippin non alcoholic beer\\nFriend: That's the golden receipt\\nFriend: Unfortunately my car only has 4 sits so we gonna take Antoni only\\nFriend: But maybe on the way back we can meet petyo or arijan and victor\\nPersona: alroght\\nPersona: I am in\\nPersona: when we start\\nPersona: Wait I will text you in abit\\nFriend: around 12 I think, we will pick u up <3\\nPersona: should I get a car?\\nPersona: Cause I also want to be in your convertible xddd\\nFriend: i meant that Antoni only counting you me and kaja xdd\\nFriend: so of course <3\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nPersona: I didnt doubt it haha\\nPersona: But I thought extra car\\nPersona: but I lent it to my aunts bfs sister\\nPersona: I am thinking if I should get a vape for the trip\\nFriend: Yes you should \ud83d\ude18\\nPersona: I have to buy one then xdd\\nFriend: Ohhh\\nPersona: do you want to stop by norrebro?\\nFriend: Do they sell vapes in cph?\\nPersona: yup, I know a very good place\\nPersona: cheapest vape I've seen\\nPersona: Should we grill something there?\\nPersona: We can get those single use grills, we just need to pick a few forks and some sauce from homes.\\nFriend: mannn that's a great idea\\nPersona: I can take forks, some sauces, paper towels\\nPersona: Btw, should I go get the vape from norrebro now, or you can stop there?\\nFriend: I think we can stop there\\nFriend: but we gonna be a bit late, like 12:30-45 at your place\\nPersona: do you live at the same place?\\nFriend: yes sir\\nPersona: I can get actually and you can pick me up from there with the vape xd. Or you buy it on the way to me\\nFriend: hmmm hard decision\\nFriend: It can be hard to park there I think\\nFriend: So maybe it's better if we pick u up with vape in the pocket\\nPersona: could be cause construction, I did mamage to park before\\nPersona: But I will go there no prob\\nFriend: If you managed then you will show me the way master.
