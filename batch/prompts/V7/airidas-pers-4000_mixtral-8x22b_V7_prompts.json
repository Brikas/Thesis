I am struggling to do any sport, so I think I'll start with the gym, that is the easiest and flexible to access. Of course will lose a nice community part but fuck the schedule is very busy\\nPersona: Hit up patryk\\nPersona: he was interested\\nPersona: XDDDD\\nPersona: ALso doritos?\\nFriend: I got something better\\nFriend: chips from sweden\\nFriend: regular ones xD\\nPersona: ohhh okay\\nPersona: I don't think I am available today at all, apprarently we have a kitchen cleaning at 19\\nPersona: get ticket\\nPersona: Can you explain the condoms?\\nFriend: Its magnum\\nFriend: Probably a big Dick move\\nFriend: To own paper stock of apple\\nPersona: ah okay\\nFriend: where'd you find that photo xD\\nFriend: wsb?\\nFriend: there is a chance the condoms hide personal information too\\nFriend: people post documents with something hiding it\n\nand often its an additional way to express yourself because you can use whatever item you want\\nFriend: ye :D\\nPersona: smart\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: uuu thats perfect\\nPersona: a cool lighter and some valve index manual\\nPersona: and a heineken beer opener\\nPersona: You know the guy is cool\\nFriend: yeah everyone has their own thing :D\n\nwhat would you use to hide stuff?\\nPersona: Fuck thats a nice question\\nPersona: Thats like a personality test for approval\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: i dont knooow\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: topics rather\\nPersona: I feel like I might be a victim of decision making paraysis again witht he topic\\nPersona: Since I am really afraid of choosing a topic that will not interst me\\nPersona: The passion multiplier is really large in most of the work that I do. So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\\nPersona: and the problem with not talking is thay it is embarassing for me\\nPersona: for example, if its a school break - I have to talk. If I just stand here and dont talk - I am a lower tier individual.\\nPersona: lets skip this topic for now, I dont want to convince you of anything, I probably cant anyways. I just know thats this is the way for me personally now\\nPersona: btw, what fun did you have awake at 3AM before Monday morning \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: ah okay. yup, it rings a bell\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: hahah this does sound exactly like the inner monologue I would expect a sales person to have\\nPersona: When one makes it big in life through STEM with the trade-off of being socially akward, then atleast it was worth it. If one is just socially akward without making it big, then why? Would better be social and enjoy the life seen in movies.\\nPersona: I would low-key like to be like the technical co-founder billionaires, who got a lot of money being nerdy and now they are super rich but awkward. Yet, when you have big money to spend you have a social life in easy mode.\\nPersona: I gotta tell you its a nice feeling. But I remember even when I had this mysterious abilitiy, it ceased to activate when work time ended. So for example when its 17 o' clock and the friday bar opens, I no longer have automatic conversations. Perhaps because I feel the pressure to do it.\\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: no worries haha\\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05"

So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind.

Then I agree.\\nPersona: You'll never know. Maybe in our families there is someone who thinks poop knife is a thing, but it never came to light yet. There is a unexplainable noise in the bacteria sickness among families statistics.\\nFriend: this is an investigation that needs to happen, but I heve yet to decide how to conduct it\\nFriend: do you know the whole picture? it's even better. it's a nun who's quite...explicit about her hobbies\\nFriend: wait, where is it\\nFriend: no idea what's up with that muppet in the background though\\nFriend: I'm willing to bet real-life money that someone at '5 minutes crafts' headquarters has pitched that idea at one point or another\\nPersona: btw, are you not sleeping?\\nPersona: Me, Denis and his wife are playing poker downstairs, do you want to join?\\nPersona: Go to kitchen of homes and check bathrooms.

Very effective. I swear, you will never lose the page you last stopped reading at\\nFriend: oh thank you, but I have shit ton of work to do before tomorrow\\nFriend: considering you use a communal kitchen, I'd advise you to take your own advice first. that would at least explain people visiting your kitchen at odd hours in the middle of the night \ud83d\udc40\\nFriend: thd penis rosary is so bomb I can't believe it's a 16th century invention\\nFriend: please enlighten me because I don't\\nFriend: the unrealised potential here bothers me a lot though. why stop at bookmark. you just need a few more condiments and you've got yourself a beautiful brand-new set of highlights\\nFriend: highlighters*\\nPersona: oh yeah, those freaks running with their pants down the hallway at midnight for that one rusty knife is definetely smth I should investigate. I always thought its a normal occurance in Tingbjerg dorm.\\nPersona: damn this even has a name. You know too much about religion haha\\nPersona: Mupped and madam had a fun time until the cat suddenly made her special penis kidnapping move. In the moment, the dude's post nut clarity enlightened him, that he shall not fuck around with them cat-penis-thieve cursed women, so he ceremoniuosly forsaken  his last womanly object and became a priest afterwards.\\nPersona: what a back story\\nPersona: mustard is next in line. That way we are sustainable, even in highlighting efforts\\nPersona: although idk where the fish comes in. Maybe you have an idea\\nFriend: welp, freaks are getting out of hand. looks like someone has dropped grandma's ashes on the ground floor\\nFriend: it has a name because I've just made it up. but it has a nice ring to it, might be patent-worthy\\nFriend: he's about to change career paths from court jester to priest? so inspiring \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc4f but look, despite that internal turmoil, he's still holding the lady's purse while she's hunting for her dick. a true gentleman\\nFriend: got you. she came prepared. the fish must've been inside the purse. you see that writing in the right bottom corner? it means 'meat makes meat' or sth. the cat's a mob boss. sends that message once in a while to signal that he'll soon come back to extort some fish\\nFriend: I'm just starting to realize that I'm not a condiment expert. do we have access to more colours than those two?\\nPersona: Its a purse? This object is so weird.\\nPersona: faaaak, I should keep some fish at hand in case the mafia cat comes for me. Lucky cats are not allowed in this dorm\\nPersona: There is mayo, chilli mayo. But we can unlock a whole new part of the spectrum if we consider jams, chacolate toppings.\\nFriend: I'm not sure either, but it's the closest association I can think of\\nFriend: yes, thank god, mob bosses are known to be stopped by laws and regulations \ud83d\ude4f actually there used to be that one shifty looking fella walking around the gardens, but I haven't seen him or her in a while\\nFriend: which is equally probable to be a good or a bad sign\\nFriend: excuse you, MAYO?! did you use white crayons as a child as well?\\nPersona: ughh they looking for their next treasure to conquer. I am infamous for taking my long trips from the shower to the closet half naked, so I am probably at the top of the hit list\\nPersona: white crayons were always mystical to me. I never used them but I have always revered its secret powers\\nFriend: yup, your days are numbered then. stock up on fish and befriend a court jester to look after your possessions before it's too late\\nFriend: that's a nice euphemism. from now on, instead of admitting that I'm useless, I'll just claim I have secret powers\\nPersona: You are in the most strategic position to look after my possessions. In case of an emergency where you can save only three items, make sure you grab my speaker, a blue Monster from the fridge, and some other absolutely essential item of your choice.\\nPersona: Can I trust you on that?\\nPersona: You have just insulted the white crayon. Gods will not forgive.\\nPersona: oh and you are allowed to quickly finish the Soplica, in case there is still some left. Think of it as compensation\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought about blue monster from the fridge before you thought about your cactus. man, you're heartless\\nFriend: I'm reporting you for plant abuse!!\\nFriend: if the white crayon was made in the image of its gods, the gods must be not particularly mighty. I'm not scared\\nFriend: trusting sober me with your possessions was already an unwise move. but trusting drunk me with your possessions? I don't even know what to say\\nPersona: So take it as a third then. You see, thats why I need you. You think of the cactuses and other actually important things\\nPersona: Trusting you sober is already a good idea\\nFriend: stop it. now you're making it seem like I don't have secret powers :c\\nPersona: you probably do, when you get that exact amount of SOP\\nPersona: Soplica Alcohol Level\\nPersona: Also was just about to ask you, do you want to hang out on Saturday? Denis and his wife are coming over and I showed them the kittens game, they want to play it again.

Now I gotta prepare for an exam on Friday \ud83e\udd74\\nPersona: But probably in the evening, cause his wife works on that day I think\\nFriend: is that how it works? at least now I know why I'm so pale \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: it's okay. I'm not in a rush to know\\nFriend: good luck!!\\nPersona: Are you so pale? At least I haven't noticed\\nPersona: I need luck, my oral examiner is infamous for throwing completely tangential, weird questions. Thanks\\nFriend: yup. I could easily become a poster child for anemia if my current career path doesn't work out\\nFriend: oof, this already gives me Vietnam flashbacks from mine. take all the luck then\\nPersona: Or you are a vampire \ud83d\ude32\\nPersona: Do you also crave for blood sometimes? You got really excited and curiuos when I said I cant handle knowing I am loosing blood. \ud83e\udd2d That may be a symptom of vampirism.\\nPersona: btw about Saturday, Denis finishes work at 23, so they want to come this late \ud83d\ude44\\nPersona: but we can meet earlier\\nFriend: wait, wasn't it with you that I was talking about sleeping in a coffin? or am I mixing up convos?

Then I agree.\\nPersona: You'll never know. Maybe in our families there is someone who thinks poop knife is a thing, but it never came to light yet. There is a unexplainable noise in the bacteria sickness among families statistics.\\nFriend: this is an investigation that needs to happen, but I heve yet to decide how to conduct it\\nFriend: do you know the whole picture? it's even better. it's a nun who's quite...explicit about her hobbies\\nFriend: wait, where is it\\nFriend: no idea what's up with that muppet in the background though\\nFriend: I'm willing to bet real-life money that someone at '5 minutes crafts' headquarters has pitched that idea at one point or another\\nPersona: btw, are you not sleeping?\\nPersona: Me, Denis and his wife are playing poker downstairs, do you want to join?\\nPersona: Go to kitchen of homes and check bathrooms. Is there a knife hanging in a bathroom? Then make a table, average bacteria sickness per year/ per capita in household. Then run regression and see if there is a correllation\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: She forgot her bra xdd\\nPersona: I can see the whole story here lol\\nPersona: Its good. Very effective. I swear, you will never lose the page you last stopped reading at\\nFriend: oh thank you, but I have shit ton of work to do before tomorrow\\nFriend: considering you use a communal kitchen, I'd advise you to take your own advice first. that would at least explain people visiting your kitchen at odd hours in the middle of the night \ud83d\udc40\\nFriend: thd penis rosary is so bomb I can't believe it's a 16th century invention\\nFriend: please enlighten me because I don't\\nFriend: the unrealised potential here bothers me a lot though. why stop at bookmark. you just need a few more condiments and you've got yourself a beautiful brand-new set of highlights\\nFriend: highlighters*\\nPersona: oh yeah, those freaks running with their pants down the hallway at midnight for that one rusty knife is definetely smth I should investigate. I always thought its a normal occurance in Tingbjerg dorm.\\nPersona: damn this even has a name. You know too much about religion haha\\nPersona: Mupped and madam had a fun time until the cat suddenly made her special penis kidnapping move. In the moment, the dude's post nut clarity enlightened him, that he shall not fuck around with them cat-penis-thieve cursed women, so he ceremoniuosly forsaken  his last womanly object and became a priest afterwards.\\nPersona: what a back story\\nPersona: mustard is next in line. That way we are sustainable, even in highlighting efforts\\nPersona: although idk where the fish comes in. Maybe you have an idea\\nFriend: welp, freaks are getting out of hand. looks like someone has dropped grandma's ashes on the ground floor\\nFriend: it has a name because I've just made it up. but it has a nice ring to it, might be patent-worthy\\nFriend: he's about to change career paths from court jester to priest? so inspiring \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc4f but look, despite that internal turmoil, he's still holding the lady's purse while she's hunting for her dick. a true gentleman\\nFriend: got you. she came prepared. the fish must've been inside the purse. you see that writing in the right bottom corner? it means 'meat makes meat' or sth. the cat's a mob boss. sends that message once in a while to signal that he'll soon come back to extort some fish\\nFriend: I'm just starting to realize that I'm not a condiment expert. do we have access to more colours than those two?\\nPersona: Its a purse? This object is so weird.\\nPersona: faaaak, I should keep some fish at hand in case the mafia cat comes for me. Lucky cats are not allowed in this dorm\\nPersona: There is mayo, chilli mayo. But we can unlock a whole new part of the spectrum if we consider jams, chacolate toppings.\\nFriend: I'm not sure either, but it's the closest association I can think of\\nFriend: yes, thank god, mob bosses are known to be stopped by laws and regulations \ud83d\ude4f actually there used to be that one shifty looking fella walking around the gardens, but I haven't seen him or her in a while\\nFriend: which is equally probable to be a good or a bad sign\\nFriend: excuse you, MAYO?! did you use white crayons as a child as well?\\nPersona: ughh they looking for their next treasure to conquer. I am infamous for taking my long trips from the shower to the closet half naked, so I am probably at the top of the hit list\\nPersona: white crayons were always mystical to me. I never used them but I have always revered its secret powers\\nFriend: yup, your days are numbered then. stock up on fish and befriend a court jester to look after your possessions before it's too late\\nFriend: that's a nice euphemism. from now on, instead of admitting that I'm useless, I'll just claim I have secret powers\\nPersona: You are in the most strategic position to look after my possessions. In case of an emergency where you can save only three items, make sure you grab my speaker, a blue Monster from the fridge, and some other absolutely essential item of your choice.\\nPersona: Can I trust you on that?\\nPersona: You have just insulted the white crayon. Gods will not forgive.\\nPersona: oh and you are allowed to quickly finish the Soplica, in case there is still some left. Think of it as compensation\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought about blue monster from the fridge before you thought about your cactus. man, you're heartless\\nFriend: I'm reporting you for plant abuse!!\\nFriend: if the white crayon was made in the image of its gods, the gods must be not particularly mighty. I'm not scared\\nFriend: trusting sober me with your possessions was already an unwise move. but trusting drunk me with your possessions? I don't even know what to say\\nPersona: So take it as a third then. You see, thats why I need you. You think of the cactuses and other actually important things\\nPersona: Trusting you sober is already a good idea\\nFriend: stop it. now you're making it seem like I don't have secret powers :c\\nPersona: you probably do, when you get that exact amount of SOP\\nPersona: Soplica Alcohol Level\\nPersona: Also was just about to ask you, do you want to hang out on Saturday? Denis and his wife are coming over and I showed them the kittens game, they want to play it again. Its actually much more fun with 4 people\\nFriend: uh oh, perhaps the white crayon just struggles with an alcohol problem then.I would like to take all the mean things I said back\\nFriend: sure! that sounds fun\\nPersona: Its white as milk, that's the clue\\nPersona: I will update you on what time. Now I gotta prepare for an exam on Friday \ud83e\udd74\\nPersona: But probably in the evening, cause his wife works on that day I think\\nFriend: is that how it works? at least now I know why I'm so pale \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: it's okay. I'm not in a rush to know\\nFriend: good luck!!\\nPersona: Are you so pale? At least I haven't noticed\\nPersona: I need luck, my oral examiner is infamous for throwing completely tangential, weird questions. Thanks\\nFriend: yup. I could easily become a poster child for anemia if my current career path doesn't work out\\nFriend: oof, this already gives me Vietnam flashbacks from mine. take all the luck then\\nPersona: Or you are a vampire \ud83d\ude32\\nPersona: Do you also crave for blood sometimes? You got really excited and curiuos when I said I cant handle knowing I am loosing blood. \ud83e\udd2d That may be a symptom of vampirism.\\nPersona: btw about Saturday, Denis finishes work at 23, so they want to come this late \ud83d\ude44\\nPersona: but we can meet earlier\\nFriend: wait, wasn't it with you that I was talking about sleeping in a coffin? or am I mixing up convos? I'm not even trying to hide my true identity at this point\\nFriend: very inopportune time to start wars. yeah let's do that\\nFriend: that I mean"

I've never felt more betrayed\\nPersona: Looks like Hermione has her side of savageness huh\\nPersona: I think Tyler Durden is the least concerned about how cool he seems or how anything he seems. Best thing Tyler taught me is to care less about the image. But I am not particularly good at this\\nPersona: And I totally agree, Tyler would be horrible to live with. He is the definition of unorderly. I am pretty sure Hermione has him under some spell.\\nPersona: But also tell me what did your pop-eyed combo instill in you?\\nFriend: I actually wouldn't be so sure about that. I think now all I see in that carelessness is a perfectly crafted picture projected with the very purpose of impressing others. after all, wasn't he the idealized version of all that Joe? Jack? - whatever his name was - ever wanted to be?\\nFriend: I believe that to be an illusion\\nFriend: although I must admit that to this man I owe a rather nonchalant attitude towards my belongings which I'm quite grateful for\\nPersona: He was an idealized way of the narrator (he had no name) like you say, but rather in a different way. To quote Tyler, he was free in every way that the narrator wished he was free. Take the blowing up of his condo as an example.\\nPersona: I see you have paid attention in the film, makes me feel good hearing that.\\nPersona: To my little embarrassment I am still yet to watch pt3 of back to the future \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: well this is not reliable, it's Tyler in the words of Tyler - he perceives himself to be free and wants to be perceived as such, doesn't mean that he is\\nFriend: I can see his behaviour as freedom when you use the narrator as the point of reference, yet I think he is a slave to his own need to prove that he's so outside of the box\\nFriend: in other words, I see him as a victim to  'I'm not like other girls' syndrome haha\\nFriend: oh man, I've seen it when I was 12 or something. I thought I discovered the meaning of life \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: you're still better than me! I haven't even seen the 2nd one\\nPersona: you're making me think so hard about this now \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: woke up my brain really well\\nPersona: It indeed came from his own lips and Tyler took quite an antagonist role in the end of the story, so thats a good point.\\nPersona: When you put him in 'I'm not like the other girls' analogy, I see how he could be trying to be different from our point of view. I might be wrong and often I am in these topics, but I think in his world, he has no concept of 'the other girls'. I think this is the kind of freedom he messages - losing the pressure from the others, so you can be anything you want to be.\\nPersona: The other part of the story, Project Mayhem, is something I yet dont fully understand, despite watching 5+ times. Tyler seemed to have criticized society as a whole and wanted some sort of chaos. Thus, we could argue that by apprearing different in the way you interpret, he attracted himself attention and capitalized on that by building a protesting empire.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: we went out and bbq\\nPersona: Yesterday party at Arijans in Nordhavn and a little swin\\nPersona: Today lake trip\\nFriend: Omg XD\\nFriend: Was it a bday gift? Magnifique \u2728\\nPersona: yup xd\\nFriend: Are the polish friends still in cph?

Unlike does exist, right?\\nFriend: It makes sens in polish xd\\nPersona: Not sure. But it makes sense when you like someones pic on IG and you have to unlike it\\nPersona: cause you can unlike it, but you cant dislike it\\nFriend: Right\\nPersona: Hey, how are you doing?\\nPersona: its been a while\\nFriend: Hey hoo\\nFriend: I\u2019m good, did a lot of fun stuff last week\\nFriend: How about you? Curious to hear about tech bbq ;)\\nPersona: what kind of fun stuff? tell me about it\\nPersona: techbbq was reaaaally good\\nPersona: Tech and startup environment - felt like at home\\nPersona: networked with great ppl\\nPersona: had some wild fun as a volunteer\\nPersona: but totally knocked me off my productive momentum, got really tired\\nFriend: I had my birthday, the loneliest but also the funniest of birthday\u2019s \ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Then it was Karo\u2019s bday. I had a fancy work party and then her dressup party the same evening\\nFriend: Any potential opportunities coming from this? \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: waaaaait, was it your birthday? Did I miss it? \ud83d\ude28\\nPersona: faaaaak\\nFriend: Yup, on Thursday. Why else would I post flowers and candles? Hahah\\nFriend: Btw I got flowers sent by mail \ud83e\udd7a it was like a movie xd\\nFriend: I was just standing in the middle of the gallery, talking with my colleagues and a random lady just came up to us with flowers and said that theyre for Anna (me)\\nFriend: My Future foundation is raising the bar xd\\nPersona: aahhh, I may have not checked IG, been using that a bit less\\nFriend: And then I met with my bffs in the forest to eat jiaozi :3 it was all fun until we got surrounded by foxes in complete darkness XD I\u2019ve never seen these guys run so fast\\nPersona: mega late but happy birthday \u2764\u2764\\nPersona: damn they sent you flowers\\nPersona: very cool\\nFriend: Thanks \ud83d\ude0c\\nPersona: so what was fun about it?\\nPersona: what did you do?\\nFriend: Yup, Kinga knows me well xd\\nFriend: I mean, getting flowers this way was fun. Also, one of our clients who\u2019s an actor recorded and posted bday wishes for me on instagram, which was extremely random\\nFriend: I didn\u2019t really do anything special, didn\u2019t feel like it\\nPersona: you are really the attention of your clients\\nPersona: you are the expensive piece of art yourself \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: Ofc I am, they pay me for it hahah"

I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\\nPersona: and the problem with not talking is thay it is embarassing for me\\nPersona: for example, if its a school break - I have to talk. If I just stand here and dont talk - I am a lower tier individual.\\nPersona: lets skip this topic for now, I dont want to convince you of anything, I probably cant anyways. I just know thats this is the way for me personally now\\nPersona: btw, what fun did you have awake at 3AM before Monday morning \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: ah okay. yup, it rings a bell\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: hahah this does sound exactly like the inner monologue I would expect a sales person to have\\nPersona: When one makes it big in life through STEM with the trade-off of being socially akward, then atleast it was worth it. If one is just socially akward without making it big, then why? Would better be social and enjoy the life seen in movies.\\nPersona: I would low-key like to be like the technical co-founder billionaires, who got a lot of money being nerdy and now they are super rich but awkward. Yet, when you have big money to spend you have a social life in easy mode.\\nPersona: I gotta tell you its a nice feeling. But I remember even when I had this mysterious abilitiy, it ceased to activate when work time ended. So for example when its 17 o' clock and the friday bar opens, I no longer have automatic conversations. Perhaps because I feel the pressure to do it.\\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: no worries haha\\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Yeah, being tired/missing out is also on of the reason\\nFriend: Btw I often drink yerba in a glass at work which is yellow with a foam\\nFriend: People stare at me but no one said anything yet\\nFriend: Waiting for a complaint that I drink beer at work\\nPersona: is yerba a beer brand?\\nFriend: It's a type of tea\\nFriend: Cold brew tea\\nFriend: But looks like beer xd\\nPersona: ahhh okay\\nPersona: xddddd casual big house party story\\nPersona: sorry but I love this story\\nFriend: How lovely!\\nFriend: I would also do that\\nFriend: 100%\\nPersona: xdddd\\nPersona: The door lock also didnt work, it was a terribly risky move\\nPersona: but my grandmas bathroom is suchhh an OP bathroom\\nPersona: the tub is max comfort, and the bathroom is huge, has very cozy lights too\\nPersona: Its so hard not to take a late night bath there actually\\nFriend: Nooo\\nFriend: One message didn't send\\nFriend: Wait\\nPersona: say it again\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd74\\nFriend: There you go!\\nFriend: It worked\\nPersona: XXDDDDDDDDDDD\\nPersona: wild shower\\nFriend: It was very much a boring one\\nFriend: Idk how I did that\\nPersona: I wonder what your non boring shower then are xd\\nFriend: Enough stories for today\\nPersona: whole house gets flooded\\nFriend: Possibly\\nPersona: alright, tommorow is in 1.5 hours \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: You got me\\nFriend: Fine\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude44\\nPersona: I am waiting for that next story\\nFriend: Tbh I'm not sure if I have any\\nFriend: Probably yes\\nFriend: But don't remember any\\nFriend: OMG WHAT IS THAY\\nFriend: I know this thing\\nFriend: Like a cartoon\\nPersona: its familiar yeah, idk where from tho\\nPersona: we have name days too\\nPersona: that is indees a bad way to get rid of people. Countereffective\\nPersona: but, you do have a cute voice \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: Aww\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: when I get to polans\\nPersona: we will do one story each until we run of out stories\\nFriend: Did you just discover having a conversation?\\nPersona: Xddd\\nFriend: Such a fun concept!\\nPersona: yeah! Great discovery. I domt usually talk to people, maybe once a year I dk\\nPersona: do*\\nFriend: Ok, but I need specific questions\\nFriend: Sometimes I get crazy and spill out all of the stories\\nFriend: But most of the times I need questions\\nPersona: you have around a week to build your stack of stories\\nFriend: One of my favorites recently is \"where do you don't want to go?\"\\nFriend: It tells you so much about a person\\nFriend: Everyone wants to go to Italy, Iceland idk\\nFriend: But no one asks you where you don't want to go and why\\nPersona: actually I should remember this. Interesting question\\nFriend: :<\\nFriend: Thanks, I made it up xd\\nFriend: But really, got so many interesting answers!\\nFriend: No stories\\nFriend: Only music now\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude4f\\nPersona: I am sitting there in silence"

I think it might be working\\nFriend: full 3 min version? because this is gold, you're missing out otherwise \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: oof, no, this is tricky socially. I don't know if there's a way out of this other than somewhat concerned 'oh okay'\\nFriend: or deflect with a question\\nFriend: I mean, as much as neurodivergence is celebrated these days, I'm sure every parents wants nothing more than for their kid to be healthy and have a life as easy as possible which is not exactly the case here\\nFriend: it is. it's referred to as hell planet for a reason. that's not the right vibe\\nFriend: milk! like a psychopath\\nFriend: yeah no, you just don't know me very well haha\\nFriend: I'm proud :')\\nFriend: oh look. now you can cry whenever and wherever you want!\\nPersona: Shampoo, bathtub and a sponge. Thats a whole depression cure kit \ud83d\ude31\\nFriend: but no Pitbull :/\\nPersona: How flat do you need to be on the ground for your famous depression repelling ritual, and is pivko neccessary?\\nPersona: I am afraid lack of Pitbull might not be the only issue here\\nPersona: I think so, I will see again\\nPersona: ok I didnt before xddd\\nPersona: but now I did xd\\nPersona: I cant believe this is real autism. It cant be that bad come on\\nPersona: With some spacer level advanced life support a hell environment would be THE vibe. You there crying in your nanotech-anti-gravity-force-field suit, while an apocalypse is raging outside. A perfect contrast, or perhaps a perfect reflection\\nPersona: I need to do this sometime as a social experiment\\nPersona: during a night out, pull out some a milk bottle, pour it in the glass, drink it and say no word\\nPersona: (without polish hazelnut vodka)\\nPersona: I must meet a polish Joanna\\nPersona: Had one of those autmatical social days at work today\\nPersona: automatic*\\nPersona: hows your job opportinity looking?\\nFriend: very flat. your exterior must look as dead as your interior feels\\nFriend: um for some time last year I had a temporary hobby of trying to establish how to measure perfect drink proportions with a very small plant pot (for the record - brand new, never used for its intended purpose lol), because I was trying to prove to my friends that it's possible. those were rum times, those dark times.

I sense something sus here\\nPersona: \"for safety reasons piwko is recomended\" I have the impression many polish people apply this as mantra to many situations\\nPersona: I think jokes floating around in my lithuanian friend group distorted my understanding of autistic\\nPersona: oh yeah, I flex everytime. When I am making coffee at work and choose between all the inclusive selection of milks, I must not take the lactose free one. I want my lactose. I always make sure I take one with lactose and I announce it verbally\\nPersona: I just noticed the message didnt sent and my phone died yesterday \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I would not do this at 10 in the morning \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: atleast not so intensely animated\\nFriend: excellent choice \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\\nFriend: oh no, bathtub is your idea. that's a you problem \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: my only battle is trying not to choke on beer\\nFriend: speaking of Poland.

You must look deadly funny drinking piwko lying flat on the ground.

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be\\nPersona: what is the correct meaning of narcissism then?\\nPersona: and how do people use it wrong?\\nPersona: force them to submission. milk tolerance dominance. everytime\\nFriend: this is an extreme sport. when I was little my mum always told me not to drink while lying down bc apparently there is a story of a girl who did that once, choked and went into coma\\nFriend: I'm so mad. I was waiting 2 years for fsb to give me my own polish person in the kitchen \ud83d\ude20\\nFriend: idk people just tend to diagnose every person who wronged them with a mental illness\\nPersona: my finding at 2 am today\\nPersona: unrelated to anything\\nPersona: (the video is the same, it just showed that it couldn't send, so I sent it again)\\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\\nPersona: well its also very unfortable.

I got woken up by a stream of water under pressure hitting that whole panel over kitchen niche. and I mean water hose kind of stream. I was trying to stop it, but it was so intense and everywhere that I couldn't even breathe. thank fuck it was 7:20 so I ran there in my pajamas without shoes just banging in the door and yelling at them to turn of the water\\nFriend: and by the time we got back the whole room was covered in like 1 cm layer of water\\nFriend: also electricity was off\\nFriend: they called some people with the machine to dry that water off, and since it started to pour down into yours they had to tear off the whole floor to dry the beton underneath\\nFriend: the best thing - I'm having my move out inspection literally tomorrow\\nPersona: crazy story, I imagined you running in pyjamas to the office \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: will you be charged for that?\\nFriend: yup, going out of my pocket. apparently you're supposed to have your own insurance for things like that here in Denmark\\nFriend: so that's the life tip from today\\nPersona: ohhhh, how much?\\nPersona: btw how r you doing? What are your plans ahead?\\nFriend: according to current estimates I'll have to pay around 7 or 8k above the deposit\\nFriend: in terms of what?\\nPersona: that is insane\\nPersona: Its something hardly in your control.

I don't know if there's a way out of this other than somewhat concerned 'oh okay'\\nFriend: or deflect with a question\\nFriend: I mean, as much as neurodivergence is celebrated these days, I'm sure every parents wants nothing more than for their kid to be healthy and have a life as easy as possible which is not exactly the case here\\nFriend: it is. it's referred to as hell planet for a reason. that's not the right vibe\\nFriend: milk! like a psychopath\\nFriend: yeah no, you just don't know me very well haha\\nFriend: I'm proud :')\\nFriend: oh look. now you can cry whenever and wherever you want!\\nPersona: Shampoo, bathtub and a sponge.

I succeeded only once\\nFriend: thus for safety reasons piwko is recommended\\nFriend: I'm so amused haha. I have no idea what you thought it was\\nFriend: that sounds hot, but not in a good sense\\nFriend: I feel like in this day and age the ability to digest lactose is a rare flex, so you could gain some respect\\nFriend: dunno. will email them next week\\nPersona: So random, I will catch up on the rest of convo later (I got 2%)\\nPersona: then you would be in danger of curing depression by drowing. I sense something sus here\\nPersona: \"for safety reasons piwko is recomended\" I have the impression many polish people apply this as mantra to many situations\\nPersona: I think jokes floating around in my lithuanian friend group distorted my understanding of autistic\\nPersona: oh yeah, I flex everytime. When I am making coffee at work and choose between all the inclusive selection of milks, I must not take the lactose free one. I want my lactose.

You must look deadly funny drinking piwko lying flat on the ground. A true piwko akrobat\\nPersona: recipe for your ritual*\\nPersona: my best polish friend is leaving denmark for a long while or maybe forever today. The universe sends me a replacement. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be\\nPersona: what is the correct meaning of narcissism then?\\nPersona: and how do people use it wrong?\\nPersona: force them to submission. milk tolerance dominance. everytime\\nFriend: this is an extreme sport. when I was little my mum always told me not to drink while lying down bc apparently there is a story of a girl who did that once, choked and went into coma\\nFriend: I'm so mad. I was waiting 2 years for fsb to give me my own polish person in the kitchen \ud83d\ude20\\nFriend: idk people just tend to diagnose every person who wronged them with a mental illness\\nPersona: my finding at 2 am today\\nPersona: unrelated to anything\\nPersona: (the video is the same, it just showed that it couldn't send, so I sent it again)\\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\\nPersona: they well pranked you there"

I succeeded only once\\nFriend: thus for safety reasons piwko is recommended\\nFriend: I'm so amused haha. I have no idea what you thought it was\\nFriend: that sounds hot, but not in a good sense\\nFriend: I feel like in this day and age the ability to digest lactose is a rare flex, so you could gain some respect\\nFriend: dunno. will email them next week\\nPersona: So random, I will catch up on the rest of convo later (I got 2%)\\nPersona: then you would be in danger of curing depression by drowing. I sense something sus here\\nPersona: \"for safety reasons piwko is recomended\" I have the impression many polish people apply this as mantra to many situations\\nPersona: I think jokes floating around in my lithuanian friend group distorted my understanding of autistic\\nPersona: oh yeah, I flex everytime. When I am making coffee at work and choose between all the inclusive selection of milks, I must not take the lactose free one. I want my lactose. I always make sure I take one with lactose and I announce it verbally\\nPersona: I just noticed the message didnt sent and my phone died yesterday \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I would not do this at 10 in the morning \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: atleast not so intensely animated\\nFriend: excellent choice \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\\nFriend: oh no, bathtub is your idea. that's a you problem \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: my only battle is trying not to choke on beer\\nFriend: speaking of Poland.

You must look deadly funny drinking piwko lying flat on the ground. A true piwko akrobat\\nPersona: recipe for your ritual*\\nPersona: my best polish friend is leaving denmark for a long while or maybe forever today. The universe sends me a replacement. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be\\nPersona: what is the correct meaning of narcissism then?\\nPersona: and how do people use it wrong?\\nPersona: force them to submission. milk tolerance dominance. everytime\\nFriend: this is an extreme sport. when I was little my mum always told me not to drink while lying down bc apparently there is a story of a girl who did that once, choked and went into coma\\nFriend: I'm so mad. I was waiting 2 years for fsb to give me my own polish person in the kitchen \ud83d\ude20\\nFriend: idk people just tend to diagnose every person who wronged them with a mental illness\\nPersona: my finding at 2 am today\\nPersona: unrelated to anything\\nPersona: (the video is the same, it just showed that it couldn't send, so I sent it again)\\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\\nPersona: they well pranked you there"

But my potfolio now is diversified into around 100+ of them\\nPersona: So I care about it too much\\nFriend: How much pr month you put in?\nI will start diversifying the gme soon\\nPersona: From non passive income I put in 14%\\nPersona: Which is around 1650dkk\\nPersona: This months it was 1900 cause I withdrew some holiday money\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: if I get money gifts from grandma I put 40 - 50% of it to investments. Sometimes she is so kind she gives me 500 eur xd\\nPersona: I manage it all with my personal finance superspreadsheet\\nPersona: It literally gives me the motivation to invest\\nPersona: this graph is just motivating to save money and invest\\nFriend: Yoo that's sick\n\nDo you have cash on it too\\nPersona: Current capital is cash\\nPersona: I just call it in Fins language xd\\nFriend: Invested beating current now\\nFriend: Cool\\nPersona: yup\\nFriend: Yellow line gonna go brr\\nPersona: thats the goal. But mostly its mannual additions, so its not like I am earning that much money\\nFriend: I should try to do something like that\n\nStarted looking for an accounting sheet for short term rentals\n\nGonna help parents manage an apartment\\nFriend: So it woukd be good to keep track of money over time personal finance like you do\\nPersona: make it yourself, its fun\\nPersona: I can recommend, I love it. I could try to copy mine (it would take some work with the mobile AppSheet integration and open banking setup), but honestly, its very well uncodumented, since I am the sole user of it, has some spaghetti google sheets formulas and probably some things that don't work 100%, so making something like that yourself is better. I just upgrade it from time to time to fit my needs.\\nPersona: I can just recomend some things that I found to really work well for me.\\nPersona: Also I think Google Sheets is a perfect development toolkit to build something where the only user is you. Its really flexible for expanding, although it has some soft limitations, where writing more complex operations is a pain if you want fast calculations, since AppsScript, which is more comprehensible works slower than native formulas.\\nPersona: For example the graph that I showed you is really expensive calculation wise. Takes around 30 second to calculate.\\nPersona: So I implemented caching to these calculations, which speeds it up, but still I have an enable button so if I am working on the spreadsheet, I don't keep in enabled.\\nPersona: Also UX posibilities is really limited, especially for data input, unless maybe make some script with low maintenance code that adds records in a convenient way. AppSheet is good making it easier to add through mobile, but AppSheet has some limitations I don't like\\nPersona: I was lookign into ReTool yesterday and they seemed very interesting, they are much more expandable, have a Google Sheets connection. Has good tools to build a decent UX. Recently added mobile support, so its effectively a better replacement for AppSheet. But pricing may be an issue, since they are b2b and free tear has some ambigious limits, like 1GB monthly bandwidth, that it kind of hard to understand, since idk how much bandwidth it uses lol, need to test.\\nPersona: The cool thing is that as long as you build the main logic inside Google Sheets, multiple tools can be used to extend the UX of the system and you can add functionality in Google Sheets, without necessarily needing to maintain the external tool, unless you want to integrate it to it.\\nPersona: gosh, why did I spam so much xd\\nPersona: feel free to low-effort read\\nFriend: Are the limitations user friendly input mostly?\\nPersona: User friendliness and convenience. F.e. after adding a new row, sometimes you just have to manually expand all of the cells from previous row, This is especially annoying if some inbetween columns are input columns.\n\nAnd two obvious fixes dont work.\n1) ArrayFormula at the top of the column to have an automatic column wide formula. That can work sometimes, but not always as I run into some limitations with them that I haven't found a workaround.\n2) Separating input columns has a tradeoff, since at once glance, I would like to see some calculated columns and some input colums. I guess I can workaround by duplicating some of new clumns now I thought... Maybe worth doing it to increase convenience\\nPersona: f.e this\\nPersona: I have to manually expand all of the grayish columns and not expand the white one, since white ones are input columns and gray ones are formula columns\\nPersona: Thats the second limitation - columns can either be manual input or calculation. They can't be both, You need to make a separate column for that (like you can see my manual conversaion rate column)\\nPersona: Integration like AppSheet can solve that as they automatically expand selected columns when entries are added\\nPersona: And I have to have separate Input Amount and Final amount columns\\nPersona: Since input amount is not always the final amount if f.e. I want to track if I got a refund on something or someone payed me back for what I baught (say a friend asks to buy them some beers)\\nPersona: Map with lamba can fix that I think\\nPersona: Went through all google sheets functions and found a cool one that I wish I knew earlier"

I rarely even remember my dreams. used to more when I was a kid, but now it's maybe 1 or 2 per year\\nFriend: and these 1 or 2 are usually just scary or confusing\\nFriend: oh yeah right, I remember you told me at some point that you were reading some interesting case study from some ivy league school (Harvard or sth)\\nFriend: god, I'm stupid. I thought by sword art you meant actual sword art \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but no my journey with anime started and ended at 1/3 of death note\\nPersona: I was imagining something like this\\nPersona: well many revolutionary inventions had a good and a dark side. It is what it is\\nPersona: oh yeah, I even tried for 20 mins to merge danish and english subtitles into one\\nPersona: but in the end didn;t work out cause all of the danish subtitles I found (which were basically same subs, but reuploaded) were very badly made and out of sync.\\nPersona: 1-2 dreams per year???

I was focused on the sword art, and didn't even realize\\nFriend: I guess I've mastered the art of people dodgeball a bit too well\\nFriend: hm back at the hospital I used to go to the trip room (the room where we put patients after giving them psychedelics). it had a bed and everything. very nice\\nFriend: so my advice would be - find the trip room\\nPersona: u have a trip room there xddd\\nFriend: we sure do\\nFriend: even stayed there overnight once\\nFriend: sadly not tripping\\nPersona: yeah, its a pretty trivial part of life. But sometimes its interesting what your mind puts you into, especially when it chooses peolple\\nPersona: Just today I can recall 2 dreams I head\\nPersona: neither fun, neither nightmares. More less fun than fun, I think I save myself in nightmare situations by just dealing with them. I never dream of the cliche demons, etc.\\nPersona: My most common nightmare is brake not working on a car\\nPersona: and the inteteresting thing is that everytime it happens, the car is going slow, usually in a parking lot and i am freaked out of denting someone elses car and mostlt having an awkward situation\\nPersona: idk id I should try to understand its meaning\\nPersona: if*\\nPersona: you sure did\\nPersona: Does the hospital give out free psychadelics, or what tha hell? Please explain!\\nPersona: Also I imagined the room way different\\nPersona: I thought its going to be one of those jamaican vibe, with plants everywhere and everything colorful\\nFriend: I think that's even worse than demons, because this can translate into real life anxiety\\nFriend: the dreams I remember the most are about going through a plane crash, or a car exploding with my dad inside, etc., so idk, my brain is a bit too dramatic\\nFriend: okay, let's fix this. how busy from very busy to super extra busy are you in the foreseeable future?\\nFriend: oh yeah, they give psilocybin to healthy people, unhealthy people, pigs, rats, whatever they can put their hands on\\nFriend: though don't get too excited. there are usually some cognitive tests involved so I think you need to be Danish to qualify\\nFriend: but if you have some Danish friends who'd like to contribute to science of tripping:\\nPersona: well, at least I dont have the thing where I am afraid someone from below the bed will grab my out of bed bounds arm\\nPersona: I cant imagine living with that\\nPersona: could you be afraid of flying?\\nPersona: I love the range of choices xdd\\nPersona: I would say very busy \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: relax time is a small neccesity of being sustainably very busy though\\nPersona: science of tripping \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: have you been ever tripping in that tripping room?\\nFriend: or sleep paralysis. ugh. I don't think I would ever sleep if I had that\\nFriend: oh yeah\\nFriend: that's embarrassing\\nFriend: but when I was in the 1st grade or so I made the grave mistake of watching THAT scene from final destination\\nFriend: and to this day\\nFriend: as much as I'd like to think that I'm a fairly logical person in most aspects of life\\nFriend: I'm def a tense flyer\\nFriend: looks like I've chosen it poorly because now I don't actually know what it implies haha\\nFriend: if you say so. I wouldn't know. poor time management\\nFriend: noo. I don't think they give it to staff ever. I know that they test paradigms on staff sometimes, but I think it's just with placebo\\nFriend: I wondered about that when I was there, but thought it may be a stupid question so never asked\\nPersona: you should scan my brain activity right now\\nPersona: i got home, got super lazy, felt super unsocial unergezined and then spent like 20 mins gatherring will power, and contemating all of the long term outcomes, to say I am not coming to my friends birthday\\nPersona: but feels so good now\\nPersona: hm I dont know it on top of my head\\nPersona: i never seen it\\nPersona: I was very afraid as a kid too\\nPersona: But not anymore now, I dont think anything changed, I just stopped. The best possible explanation is that I decided that if I ever die, plane crash would be the coolest way.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like where you work or live?\\nFriend: Where my heart belongs\\nFriend: I just have many places there that I visit often\\nPersona: ohh okay\\nFriend: Is there an age limit?\\nFriend: On vybe\\nPersona: no clue, but why?\\nPersona: you want to take ur dad? xs\\nFriend: Idk, to me that sounds like teenagers\\nFriend: The way everything is written\\nPersona: the Vybe app or this particular event?\\nFriend: If there's no age limit/filter than it means that there's a chance of getting into kids party xd\\nFriend: Sorry for disappearing, had lots of clients\\nPersona: mix of ages I guess\\nFriend: Current vibe\\nFriend: It's almost storm in Warsaw\\nFriend: Very dark, with lightnings but no rain\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\\nFriend: Lmao\\nFriend: Wtf\\nFriend: Where is it going to be exactly?\\nFriend: Curious \ud83d\udc40\\nFriend: When exactly do you want to stay at my place?\\nPersona: sounds like a cozy atmosphere for a movie \ud83e\udd22\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c*\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Letting your real emotion takeover\\nPersona: xxd\\nPersona: I am so lazy today\\nPersona: I slept like 10hrs, now took another nap\\nPersona: I reached the peak of laziness\\nFriend: Is there a chance that you might be pregnant? :O\\nFriend: Be careful!\\nFriend: Or sleep deprived\\nFriend: Only two options\\nPersona: I think there is also a real chance I am sick\\nPersona: I had this lingering sore throat for a few days now\\nPersona: but I will see\\nPersona: probably just lazy\\nPersona: Would you recomend Saturday-Sunday-Monday?

Gonna be super interesting\\nPersona: I decided to stay away from school, I have residual cought and dont want to spread the virus\\nPersona: so no swaps for me\\nFriend: Swap the virus\\nFriend: Understandable\\nPersona: There is this lecturer and he is showing such obvious stuff, I can hardly resist laughing\\nPersona: I am just texting you to calm down\\nPersona: this dude talka abour vr company he has and its so stupid\\nPersona: Fractals in VR, for B2B to relax people\\nPersona: and they buy for 300$/mo\\nPersona: they are in a very profitanle headset renting business\\nFriend: Sell pills with jt\\nFriend: It\\nFriend: Ed/Corinne for movie or nah?\\nFriend: For \ud83d\udc3a  of Wallstreet\\nPersona: Thats fine with me\\nFriend: when you write reports in cbs how do you count pages and figures\\nFriend: were having trouble figurng it out\\nPersona: We reask every teacher, but there is a general rule how many chars per page\\nPersona: I dont remember now :D\\nPersona: I can look later at home\\nFriend: yes if you have some rules it would be nice \nbecause we have none atm ;x\\nFriend: is this the one you have\\nPersona: ywah\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: this would fit my study music in a weird way\\nPersona: This is nice\\nPersona: I am going\\nPersona: nice find\\nFriend: I will try to go to the pre party too\\nPersona: there is a pre-party for this event?\\nPersona: got that ticket for that too\\nFriend: \ud83d\udc80\u00a0i need sleep and I have to hand in another exam within 24 hrs\n\nmaybe just fail myself on that one idk\\nPersona: brocoli is my food's food \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: exam got annuled\\nFriend: ???\\nPersona: Cause they literally copied one of their prev. exams xdd\\nPersona: and evrryone us\u0119d it\\nPersona: it was 1:1\\nPersona: And we had answerrs\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: fun until you get a stab in your finger I guesss\\nPersona: But since I don't need the extra fingers...\\nPersona: darts with knives I imagine is kinda hrd\\nPersona: hard*\\nFriend: oh good point. didn't think about that. well, you just need proper mittens\\nFriend: it was! and the target is above the fridge, which doesn't help at all\\nPersona: yeah if by proper you kean kevlar or steel \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: how badly did you destroy the fridge?\\nFriend: of course I went to google to check if it's a thing\\nFriend: turns out we were wrong\\nFriend: you just need to read a book\\nFriend: as you may know, this is a recurring game in 10.2 and the average is 2 holes per match, I would say. thank gods for magnets\\nPersona: I already like ir from the tagline ahah\\nPersona: even more\\nPersona: Holy shit xdd You put magnets to cover the holes. Thats so smart, but it still does not cancel out the stupid decision to place the board above fridgea\\nPersona: I need to see this fridge though \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: two ungoogable questions that are going to torment me now is how many copies did they sell and whether that single positive review was placed by the author themselves or rather their family member\\nFriend: coincidentally, in the Christmas package my parents sent me 2 fridge magnets. seemed strange at the time, but I think they know me better than I'd like to admit\\nFriend: no no, it's not a board, it's a thermobox so you don't really have that many options at an appropriate height\\nPersona: I will buy a copy and post a review. So then you will know atleast 50% of the truth\\nPersona: oh wow\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\\nFriend: please do\\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\\nPersona: but its also not me, wait I'll check in the kitchen\\nPersona: After drinking all of it at once, all I could probably reach would be my floor \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Sometimes, not all the times of course, when some issue pain connects you to another, the another then may become like an anchor keeping your from solving that issue\\nPersona: But not all the time of course\\nPersona: nope, no traces of drilling\\nPersona: was it your kitchen then?\\nPersona: wanna take a look? xd\\nFriend: doesn't seems so. if it's not your next door neighbour, must be those kitchen ghosts of yours\\nFriend: hahah, maybe that's the road to happiness\\nPersona: but it came from the kitchen side 100%\\nPersona: I really want to try a shot of this, but I cant find an opportunity\\nFriend: nonono, that's debatable. I was sitting pressed against that wall and from my perspective it seemed like the opposite end\\nFriend: just wait till round 3 of drilling. you may need it\\nPersona: hmm maybe, okay, whatever, none of us get to see the home upgrade \ud83d\ude2a\\nPersona: in that case you need it too\\nPersona: I am cold, I need some fireball, oh well!\\nFriend: and - do you feel a sudden urge to chant fireball?\\nPersona: did you just assume that I drank it?\\nPersona: you are right, I did, but I dont think I drank enough to release the secrets\\nFriend: didn't have to. I made that inference based on auditory data coming from my window\\nPersona: oh dear, all sounds of the fire dragons rumbling and the blazing fireballs must have leaked outside\\nPersona: I must apologize if that caused great inconvenience\\nFriend: haha no, you can take apology back. I was working until 4:30 for unrelated reasons, so all sources of free entertainment including sounds of gradually intensifying chaos were very welcome"

But maybe it will get bette\\nPersona: I am not saying it has to be banned. It should be a choice. Cause we had exam out of it, so if you want a 10, its not a choice then\\nPersona: Nietche is fine for me personally, but I'll take the rant I have written and chose to omit from before about the hunger artist\\nPersona: The hunger artist is about a man, I think Kafka himself, who starved himself to death, because he had a disease that made it too painful to eat.\\nPersona: That may make me sound superficial, but since I read that book, I have grown so many fears. That pain could be such big physical pain that existing would be worse than non-existing. That fear is really not good for me. Everytime I get some weird unexplainable pain in for example joints, I am like \"faaak I will be The Not Moving Artist\" or if I get some random numbness I will be like \"The Paralyzed Artist\". That is making me too worried and scared of life.\\nPersona: Of course, it's a tradeoff, cause if that causes me to take fewer risks, I may overall ensure higher well-being and safety, but too much fear and risk-aversion can lead to the slowing of progress. And honestly I feel like I am not doing and risk-taking enough.\\nPersona: So I would have preferred to never know about it. I know that makes me sound terrible and superficial, cause I refuse to know about suffering and suffering is such a virtuous quality and yada yada\\nFriend: haha based on popularity of reddit book-based bots, thus may be a goldmine. I'd be surprised though if nobody has done anything similar yet\\nFriend: yeaaah, that one sounds rough and not really necessary. what was that supposed to teach you?\\nFriend: I sympathize, had read my fair share of graphic war-related stuff and medical stuff\\nFriend: actually, I'm impressed with literature you guys get at school, because our whole curriculum was Polish books about farmers. and war. and farmers going to war (to spice it up)\\nFriend: I still think that forcing people to read Nietzsche at school is a smart move, even for the reasons you stated. I think usually people reach for those works when they are down and alone, and therefore more susceptible to that philosophy, as it seems to confirm what they already believe. by deconstructing it in a class environment, you get inputs from people of opposing views, you are shown the weak points and so on\\nPersona: you lurk in Reddit? \ud83d\ude2e\\nPersona: I dont know actually. We never deeply discussed it, just got an intro and summary\\nPersona: ughh medical stuff. I cant take. I once was in blood testing lab for a school excursion and I didnt even see blood I almost fainted. But it was fine afterwards cause they gave me candy\\nPersona: Also its weird cause I can easily murder people in video games full of gore and dont care. I always get freaked out about my own blood.\\nPersona: Maybe its because I has internstional program. But we had some lithuanian literature. The iconis one is \"Kliud\u017eiau\" where a kid shoots a cat. Kliud\u017eiau means smth like \"got in to the way\"\\nPersona: But I mostlt liked international. I wrote a nice essay about Doolhouse\\nPersona: actually its a play by henrik ibsen\\nPersona: I agree that its nice if they show the weak points of those philosophies. Also, what do you think depressed people really do in modern times? Do they really resort to reading philosophical books?\\nFriend: oh lord, Reddit raised me. the damage has been done. and sealed. I just thank the gods I was too young to experience 4chan\\nFriend: so just to suffer. I think there are some horrifying things previous generations had to read and now they get a bit of schadenfreude from watching kids go through the same torture\\nFriend: of maybe that's a Polish thing\\nFriend: because we have at least one of those\\nFriend: there's this classic from 17th century I had to read when I was 12. and there (spoiler!) a bad guy gets impaled (?) or whatever the English term for that is\\nFriend: my parents were very amused while watching me getting traumatized\\nFriend: oooo I have questions!\\nFriend: I never meet people like that, because everyone in the medical field is so desensitized\\nFriend: okay games, but what about movies?\\nFriend: or documentaries?\\nFriend: and is it different when it's somebody else's blood compared to yours?\\nFriend: and does it have to be actively drawn or if it's just chilling somewhere it's also bad?\\nFriend: for sociopathic fun or...?\\nFriend: the title sounds familiar, but idk if it's because it's uncharacteristic or I've actually heard it. was there some big film based on it?\\nFriend: I think few people read the whole book, most likely they just come across some catchphrases taken out of context, which is even worse\\nPersona: impossibl. I thought hot girls like you don't use reddit\\nPersona: But I am a redditor too, although I deleted the app recently cause I started spending to much time scrolling in silly subs\\nPersona: I have recently revised the museum of reddit subreddit, so got back into it a bit\\nPersona: holy shit this word, we were all fascinated about it in English class I remember, it was the main troll joke of our English class for a year. Even teacher was on it.\\nPersona: but eh I don't think so that was the case in my class. Our literature teacher was the best mix of everything. I enjoyed doing analysis in her classes so much.\\nPersona: Damn they make you read this and then say video games cause violence. Unacceptable\\nPersona: Yes. Bingo\\nPersona: To this ^\\nPersona: And bingo number two kinda\\nPersona: You asked the right questions\\nPersona: Basically I only feel uncomfortable when my blood is involved in the situation. But this is also a bit complex. I would not mind seeing my blood like chilling somewhere, so a finger cut that I quickly cover does not bother me at all. So to be prescise, its the fact of knowing that I have less blood now that bothers me. As soon as I think some blood is drawn from me I start to feel shivers (even now as I am typing).\\nPersona: It would be probably really funny if you saw me getting a blood test. I always make sure I make good friends with the nurse so she gives me great treatment. Then I exaggerate how I don't like the sight of my blood and I never look to the blood that was drawn from me.\\nPersona: Once I haad a terrible experience. The nurse failed to take my blood like three times, the vein 'didn't work' or smth, no blood was coming. You can imagine how I felt.\\nPersona: But the blood tests are not really a big issue, not even an issue. The worst part is that I can never get myself to donate blood. My friends do it regularly and I always skip, cause I would not be able to live with the fact that I have less blood, even if it's temporary. In my mind I am like imagining air gaps in the blood vessels, as there is not enough blood to fill whole volume.\\nPersona: I don't even remember the plot. All I can remember that this kid killed the cat and the word 'Kliud\u017eiau\" was kind of ironic and it became a joke around lithuanian students.\\nPersona: about that ^\\nPersona: Yeah. I watched the film called \"The Turin Horse\"\\nPersona: It was once of kind film\\nPersona: It was basically an moving picture of meaninglessnes\\nPersona: This review summarizes the film really well\\nPersona: And it was related to what a horse that Nietzsche saw being beaten.\\nPersona: damn I need to watch this film again\\nFriend: suuuure. careful there or you'll drop your fedora!\\nFriend: omg I know! it's ridiculously addictive\\nFriend: oh no, once you give in to check that one little thing, it's over\\nFriend: it's so useful. idk how the rest of languages managed without it. actually I love all those strange words from different languages describing very very specific phenomena. I don't think we have anything like that\\nFriend: only now it's occurred to me how concerning it is that this dude just casually knew a step-by-step instructions to impalement. bit of a weird flex\\nFriend: although he later got a Nobel prize, so perhaps that's the way\\nFriend: woah what?! that's soo cool. I thought it's just purely sensory, but it looks like there's a pretty complex cognitive process underneath. have you always felt that way?\\nFriend: that's totally understandable. that is a lot of blood\\nFriend: oooh that one. yeah it's been in my periphery for a long time, but I've always been sort of afraid to watch it\\nFriend: for the same reason I've never seen Space Odyssey or The Holy Mountain\\nFriend: because I don't know if I'm able to form an opinion independent of their acclaim. if I like it, is it because of conformism? if I don't, is it because I didn't understand?\\nFriend: I wonder when it's lost those two stars\\nFriend: okay, I suppose this is the end of this conversation\\nFriend: I'm sorry if I unknowingly did something that caused this. regardless, I really enjoyed talking to you and wish you all the best:)\\nFriend: well, inevitably - see you around\\nPersona: no wait\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\\nPersona: they well pranked you there\\nPersona: Are you also going to the queens riterement like everyone else seems to?\\nFriend: hahah wait til you spot one of these bad boys in the wild. it's going to blow your mind\\nFriend: TIL that's it's surprisingly difficult to find a good picture of a truck on the internet\\nFriend: but I'm doing that for the benefit of humanity. am I a hero yet?\\nFriend: noo I was at work all day. don't even know what I've missed. did they go out to wave or what?\\nPersona: you mean a truck \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I saw a truck\\nPersona: I was so surprised of this car because its like a personal daily vehicle of this size\\nPersona: thats whay they have in US\\nPersona: US vs EU top selling car\\nPersona: but what is the benefit?\\nFriend: I know, I know. I'm just teasing you\\nFriend: had no idea, but yup, sounds about American\\nFriend: you can look at this from 2 perspectives: 1) I'm working on a therapy aimed to help people suffering from severe cases of dead social battery; 2) currently I'm protecting people from the grumpiness induced by my own severe case of dead social battery\\nFriend: thank you. that was a perfect field report\\nFriend: I accept it as the official version of historical events and refuse to listen to or read anything else about it\\nFriend: oh wow. that's really a lot of people\\nFriend: aw they're so cute with their little flags\\nPersona: its perfect for americans, think about it - you can fit a family of 5 highly overweight persons and at the same time mount a 50cal in the back in case of property defence situation or just for fun.\\nPersona: I might need to sign up for your clinical trials. Is there a placebo piwko and placebo pitbull for control?\\nPersona: You are welcome. You are saving yourself time\\nPersona: \"I also been there, drank beer and wine, but didnt have nothing in my mouth\"\\nPersona: many Lithuanian tales end by a peasant saying this phrase\\nPersona: And when I was there I felt like a peasant\\nFriend: I've always wondered how come US people live out of their cars when they become homeless, but now it makes much more sense. why do you even need a house at this point\\nFriend: placebo piwko - easy, just alco free. placebo pitbull - I guess I'll have to kidnap some bald dude in sunglasses to act as an impersonator. but how will I trick people into thinking they're lying down \ud83e\udd14\\nFriend: if they didn't have nothing, does it mean that they had something? if they in fact didn't have anything, which orifice did the beer and wine enter through? I have questions\\nPersona: I may have added the double negative myself, but thats how it used to say. I always interpret that they didnt have anything to eat\\nPersona: but it shouldnt work if they are just lying with alco free piwko and a bald dude singing pitbull, right? So it should be fine. Its like the shell of the medicine - placebos still have the shell, but not the substance.\\nPersona: They neee to think ita serious\\nPersona: problem that they may still choke and die from placebos, cause they would need to drink when lying\\nFriend: what I get out of this is that the lack of snacks must've been a significant issue at Lithuanian parties once upon a time. you all are angry about that to this day\\nFriend: soo in a perfect world you would like to test the impact of each factor, because you don't know if all are significant or not\\nFriend: but as you can imagine cost wise and statistically it would really suck so no one does studies this complex\\nFriend: what do you mean they need to think it's serious?! it is very serious\\nFriend: I'm so happy to be quoting this legend\\nPersona: I don't actually know why it says that, I just google the actual quote and its \"Ir a\u0161 ten buvau, al\u0173 mid\u0173 g\u0117riau, per barzd\u0105 varv\u0117jo, burnoj netur\u0117jau... \" It means \"And I have also been there, I have drunk beer and mead,  so much it was dripping through my beard, had nothing in my mouth...\"\\nPersona: It was always a mystery to me, I always for some reason assumed that it was because the storyteller was just a peasant in the story and didn't get to eat, but I don't know if that makes sense, since drinks were probably more expensive. Or not? This is mostly medieval times\\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\\nPersona: I can be your test rat\\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\\nFriend: and we measure the difference\\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\\nFriend: who said that's desired?\\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\\nFriend: well, was worth a try \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\\nPersona: that is a cool way. Cant you also be your own study subject? I will randomize the piwko for you\\nPersona: the its n=2\\nPersona: But why not? I want both fancy, what do you mean?\\nPersona: Our language is oldest european, so they stole from us \ud83e\udd78\\nPersona: that is true\\nPersona: somehow\\nPersona: I remember back in highschool I had the desperate friends, with whom I drank sometimes and they were really seeking for tips how to get drunk cheapest. Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society"

I also only take edibles at home or somewhere where I can just fall asleep if I had to\\nPersona: I once took edibles a not so close friend\\nPersona: and had to get back home at night\\nPersona: holy shit this trip was magically terryfing\\nPersona: we can just do it at my place, two of us\\nPersona: We can take cookies, or actually one cookie from her\\nPersona: Because she said she accidentally made them a bit stronger than usual\\nFriend: Oki, sounds like a plan\\nFriend: Ahh Im vibing to classic rock and Im loving it so much\\nFriend: Because of your army song xd it started it all\\nFriend: Im taking the jbl on a yacht, gonna make them listen to my music xd\\nPersona: Vybe to \"I love rock n roll\". Its classic rock about loving classic rock\\nPersona: I was about to say I listen to this too, then I remembered\\nFriend: More into ballads rn\\nFriend: But it\u2019s a good one!\\nPersona: send me some\\nPersona: I am now watching another tv series\\nPersona: WeCrashed\\nPersona: its about the terrible startup WeWork, but idc, its still looks inspiring\\nPersona: reminds me of Vybe\\nFriend: Pls ignore selena and beyonce \ud83d\ude4f\\nFriend: Why is it terrible?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\\nPersona: they well pranked you there\\nPersona: Are you also going to the queens riterement like everyone else seems to?\\nFriend: hahah wait til you spot one of these bad boys in the wild. it's going to blow your mind\\nFriend: TIL that's it's surprisingly difficult to find a good picture of a truck on the internet\\nFriend: but I'm doing that for the benefit of humanity. am I a hero yet?\\nFriend: noo I was at work all day. don't even know what I've missed. did they go out to wave or what?\\nPersona: you mean a truck \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I saw a truck\\nPersona: I was so surprised of this car because its like a personal daily vehicle of this size\\nPersona: thats whay they have in US\\nPersona: US vs EU top selling car\\nPersona: but what is the benefit?\\nFriend: I know, I know. I'm just teasing you\\nFriend: had no idea, but yup, sounds about American\\nFriend: you can look at this from 2 perspectives: 1) I'm working on a therapy aimed to help people suffering from severe cases of dead social battery; 2) currently I'm protecting people from the grumpiness induced by my own severe case of dead social battery\\nFriend: thank you. that was a perfect field report\\nFriend: I accept it as the official version of historical events and refuse to listen to or read anything else about it\\nFriend: oh wow. that's really a lot of people\\nFriend: aw they're so cute with their little flags\\nPersona: its perfect for americans, think about it - you can fit a family of 5 highly overweight persons and at the same time mount a 50cal in the back in case of property defence situation or just for fun.\\nPersona: I might need to sign up for your clinical trials. Is there a placebo piwko and placebo pitbull for control?\\nPersona: You are welcome. You are saving yourself time\\nPersona: \"I also been there, drank beer and wine, but didnt have nothing in my mouth\"\\nPersona: many Lithuanian tales end by a peasant saying this phrase\\nPersona: And when I was there I felt like a peasant\\nFriend: I've always wondered how come US people live out of their cars when they become homeless, but now it makes much more sense. why do you even need a house at this point\\nFriend: placebo piwko - easy, just alco free. placebo pitbull - I guess I'll have to kidnap some bald dude in sunglasses to act as an impersonator. but how will I trick people into thinking they're lying down \ud83e\udd14\\nFriend: if they didn't have nothing, does it mean that they had something? if they in fact didn't have anything, which orifice did the beer and wine enter through? I have questions\\nPersona: I may have added the double negative myself, but thats how it used to say. I always interpret that they didnt have anything to eat\\nPersona: but it shouldnt work if they are just lying with alco free piwko and a bald dude singing pitbull, right? So it should be fine. Its like the shell of the medicine - placebos still have the shell, but not the substance.\\nPersona: They neee to think ita serious\\nPersona: problem that they may still choke and die from placebos, cause they would need to drink when lying\\nFriend: what I get out of this is that the lack of snacks must've been a significant issue at Lithuanian parties once upon a time. you all are angry about that to this day\\nFriend: soo in a perfect world you would like to test the impact of each factor, because you don't know if all are significant or not\\nFriend: but as you can imagine cost wise and statistically it would really suck so no one does studies this complex\\nFriend: what do you mean they need to think it's serious?! it is very serious\\nFriend: I'm so happy to be quoting this legend\\nPersona: I don't actually know why it says that, I just google the actual quote and its \"Ir a\u0161 ten buvau, al\u0173 mid\u0173 g\u0117riau, per barzd\u0105 varv\u0117jo, burnoj netur\u0117jau... \" It means \"And I have also been there, I have drunk beer and mead,  so much it was dripping through my beard, had nothing in my mouth...\"\\nPersona: It was always a mystery to me, I always for some reason assumed that it was because the storyteller was just a peasant in the story and didn't get to eat, but I don't know if that makes sense, since drinks were probably more expensive. Or not? This is mostly medieval times\\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\\nPersona: I can be your test rat\\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\\nFriend: and we measure the difference\\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\\nFriend: who said that's desired?\\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\\nFriend: well, was worth a try \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\\nPersona: that is a cool way. Cant you also be your own study subject? I will randomize the piwko for you\\nPersona: the its n=2\\nPersona: But why not? I want both fancy, what do you mean?\\nPersona: Our language is oldest european, so they stole from us \ud83e\udd78\\nPersona: that is true\\nPersona: somehow\\nPersona: I remember back in highschool I had the desperate friends, with whom I drank sometimes and they were really seeking for tips how to get drunk cheapest. Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society"

But who knows\\nPersona: I may have done one weird thing actually\\nPersona: you may.have even heard it xdd\\nPersona: I had a friend over and it was late, I dont remember if we were drunk, but I started ranting on how hard it is to cut carrot, so I we tried slicing them katana style and I think the noise was a bit too loud and scary. Cause the next morning I saw two neighbours asking what the hell was that\\nPersona: I apoligized for cutting my carrots in a wrong way though xd\\nFriend: I don't think so. you know, you can hear when there are multiple people inside a room, and also now I recall from that party that he doesn't drink\\nFriend: no, jokes aside, I think that poor guy may just have some health issues, mental or not, and he denied it, because he was embarrassed\\nFriend: hahaha what? how loud can you cut a carrot? were you cutting it with a chainsaw or sth\\nFriend: you know, once at an afterbar afterparty we had a cabbage cutting competition. needless to say, fingers were cut open. you'd love it\\nPersona: fair enough, could be\\nPersona: Damn, I feel bad for the cabbages tgat were murdered\\nFriend: I think that was the most detailed mental visualization of potatoes I've done in my life\\nFriend: but that's why I first cut the carrot in half along the main axis, and slice it after. knife gets a better grip. the drawback is that you're forced to lead a sad life with semicircles instead of circles of carrot, so there's that\\nPersona: wait did I say potatoes\\nPersona: oh fuck I did\\nPersona: I meant carrots\\nPersona: I think I explained it poorly, cause my problem is exatcly cutting in on the main axis\\nPersona: like the knife slips\\nFriend: oh I thought it was intentional haha - to first really flesh out the idea of the extent of circularity we're dealing with here, and then move onto the actual target\\nFriend: wait, are we talking about the same thing?\\nFriend: look\\nFriend: original\\nFriend: step one\\nFriend: step two\\nPersona: If I said smth that barely makes sense, I probably made a typo. I am infamous for my typos. Please dont assume, or you'll end up like in one of those 'instructions not clear ...' memes haha\\nPersona: my problem is step one \ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\\nPersona: wait, I'll illustrate in a bit\\nPersona: if the blue arrow is where I want to cut, then the red one is where the trajectory ends up being\\nFriend: shh it was just an unintentionally poetic description. let it be\\nFriend: oh stand the carrot up on the cutting board, so that the wider end touches the board, and thinner end points towards the ceiling. cut from the very tip down to the other end. voila\\nFriend: just to make it even, it's better not to place it like this: 0, rather turn it by 90 degrees\\nPersona: OKAY. This actually might work\\nPersona: I'll try it\\nPersona: But I dont get this part\\nPersona: 0 is like standing?\\nPersona: but if its 90 deg. then its lying again\\nPersona: How much crazy good pool shots do I owe you for that?\\nFriend: might work?! have some faith in me. this a technique supported by over a decade of experience\\nFriend: trust me, you could cut carrots like that even if you were a character in 'a quiet place'\\nFriend: yeah, I felt it wasn't a clear explantation. don't worry about it too much, unless you're very pedantic, but - ideally cross-section of a carrot would be a circle and you would cut through its diameter, right? but irl it's probably more of an ellipse or at least it's uneven. through trial and error I've learnt that's it's better to cut through the shortest possible diameter, so that you have more volume on the sides of the knife\\nFriend: I'll let you decide. once you try it, tell me how much you think it's worth\\nPersona: I really need to learn this technique. Might be useful if we end up in a world like this after out time travel masterplan\\nPersona: I think you discovered a level above rocked science in terms of difficulty - carrot science.\\nPersona: I want carrot sticks, so I never do the step 3\\nPersona: step2*\\nPersona: I think you are rather explaining about cutting them in circles (elipses)\\nPersona: you better take an advance payment, cause there is a risk that as a begginner I stab myself with this new technique\\nFriend: I hope I can add PhD in Carrot Science to my resume\\nFriend: nonono, it's all about step 1. I think you will figure it out yourself, because it's pretty intuitive. if not, I'll just show you one day\\nFriend: I'm flexible. I'll accept payment in blood as well. just try not to cut your finger off, or we'll be in trouble\\nFriend: now that I think about it, maybe pool doesn't require all fingers - feel free to cut some off, just choose carefully\\nPersona: Hope I can get my hands on some carrots in Wales, otherwise I'll do it in my Tingbjerg carrot lab\\nPersona: You are free to come and collect my blood if I end myself trying to cut a carrot.\\nPersona: I think two on the left hand is enough. I guess then there is no use for the rest in life.\\nPersona: I might leave the middle finger just for fun though\\nFriend: ugh how inconvenient. I'll charge you extra for that\\nFriend: I suppose counting on fingers will become slightly tedious, but perhaps you can get by\\nFriend: just don't forget to put the rest in the freezer. they're probably not particularly valuable, but you can always find some madlad in need of an eccentric lucky charm\\nPersona: You can collect my heart too then. But please make good use of my organs.\\nPersona: We have a decimal number system for 10 fingers, so with eight fingers, I will have to use the octal system. Might take time to adapt\\nPersona: In the shared kitchen freezer, right?\\nFriend: I can sell them, sell them or sell them. what do you want me to invest in then?\\nFriend: the have clearly given us those huge freezers for a reason. it would be disrespectful to reject the offer\\nPersona: So if you had my heart, you would just sell it? \ud83d\ude1f\\nPersona: yeah, perfect for Tingbjerg finger cutting massacre\\nFriend: out of all possible uses of a resected heart I can think of, this one is the least creepy, so I'd take it if I were you \ud83d\udc40\\nFriend: oh so you're not stopping at your own fingers?\\nPersona: What if it's still beating in love? Would you still sell it?\\nPersona: Well if it's set up like that, probably the kollegium secretly implies that such finger removal campaign must be committed.

But maybe it will get bette\\nPersona: I am not saying it has to be banned. It should be a choice. Cause we had exam out of it, so if you want a 10, its not a choice then\\nPersona: Nietche is fine for me personally, but I'll take the rant I have written and chose to omit from before about the hunger artist\\nPersona: The hunger artist is about a man, I think Kafka himself, who starved himself to death, because he had a disease that made it too painful to eat.\\nPersona: That may make me sound superficial, but since I read that book, I have grown so many fears. That pain could be such big physical pain that existing would be worse than non-existing. That fear is really not good for me. Everytime I get some weird unexplainable pain in for example joints, I am like \"faaak I will be The Not Moving Artist\" or if I get some random numbness I will be like \"The Paralyzed Artist\". That is making me too worried and scared of life.\\nPersona: Of course, it's a tradeoff, cause if that causes me to take fewer risks, I may overall ensure higher well-being and safety, but too much fear and risk-aversion can lead to the slowing of progress. And honestly I feel like I am not doing and risk-taking enough.\\nPersona: So I would have preferred to never know about it. I know that makes me sound terrible and superficial, cause I refuse to know about suffering and suffering is such a virtuous quality and yada yada\\nFriend: haha based on popularity of reddit book-based bots, thus may be a goldmine. I'd be surprised though if nobody has done anything similar yet\\nFriend: yeaaah, that one sounds rough and not really necessary. what was that supposed to teach you?\\nFriend: I sympathize, had read my fair share of graphic war-related stuff and medical stuff\\nFriend: actually, I'm impressed with literature you guys get at school, because our whole curriculum was Polish books about farmers. and war. and farmers going to war (to spice it up)\\nFriend: I still think that forcing people to read Nietzsche at school is a smart move, even for the reasons you stated. I think usually people reach for those works when they are down and alone, and therefore more susceptible to that philosophy, as it seems to confirm what they already believe. by deconstructing it in a class environment, you get inputs from people of opposing views, you are shown the weak points and so on\\nPersona: you lurk in Reddit? \ud83d\ude2e\\nPersona: I dont know actually. We never deeply discussed it, just got an intro and summary\\nPersona: ughh medical stuff. I cant take. I once was in blood testing lab for a school excursion and I didnt even see blood I almost fainted. But it was fine afterwards cause they gave me candy\\nPersona: Also its weird cause I can easily murder people in video games full of gore and dont care. I always get freaked out about my own blood.\\nPersona: Maybe its because I has internstional program. But we had some lithuanian literature. The iconis one is \"Kliud\u017eiau\" where a kid shoots a cat. Kliud\u017eiau means smth like \"got in to the way\"\\nPersona: But I mostlt liked international. I wrote a nice essay about Doolhouse\\nPersona: actually its a play by henrik ibsen\\nPersona: I agree that its nice if they show the weak points of those philosophies. Also, what do you think depressed people really do in modern times? Do they really resort to reading philosophical books?\\nFriend: oh lord, Reddit raised me. the damage has been done. and sealed. I just thank the gods I was too young to experience 4chan\\nFriend: so just to suffer. I think there are some horrifying things previous generations had to read and now they get a bit of schadenfreude from watching kids go through the same torture\\nFriend: of maybe that's a Polish thing\\nFriend: because we have at least one of those\\nFriend: there's this classic from 17th century I had to read when I was 12. and there (spoiler!) a bad guy gets impaled (?) or whatever the English term for that is\\nFriend: my parents were very amused while watching me getting traumatized\\nFriend: oooo I have questions!\\nFriend: I never meet people like that, because everyone in the medical field is so desensitized\\nFriend: okay games, but what about movies?\\nFriend: or documentaries?\\nFriend: and is it different when it's somebody else's blood compared to yours?\\nFriend: and does it have to be actively drawn or if it's just chilling somewhere it's also bad?\\nFriend: for sociopathic fun or...?\\nFriend: the title sounds familiar, but idk if it's because it's uncharacteristic or I've actually heard it. was there some big film based on it?\\nFriend: I think few people read the whole book, most likely they just come across some catchphrases taken out of context, which is even worse\\nPersona: impossibl. I thought hot girls like you don't use reddit\\nPersona: But I am a redditor too, although I deleted the app recently cause I started spending to much time scrolling in silly subs\\nPersona: I have recently revised the museum of reddit subreddit, so got back into it a bit\\nPersona: holy shit this word, we were all fascinated about it in English class I remember, it was the main troll joke of our English class for a year. Even teacher was on it.\\nPersona: but eh I don't think so that was the case in my class. Our literature teacher was the best mix of everything. I enjoyed doing analysis in her classes so much.\\nPersona: Damn they make you read this and then say video games cause violence. Unacceptable\\nPersona: Yes. Bingo\\nPersona: To this ^\\nPersona: And bingo number two kinda\\nPersona: You asked the right questions\\nPersona: Basically I only feel uncomfortable when my blood is involved in the situation. But this is also a bit complex. I would not mind seeing my blood like chilling somewhere, so a finger cut that I quickly cover does not bother me at all. So to be prescise, its the fact of knowing that I have less blood now that bothers me. As soon as I think some blood is drawn from me I start to feel shivers (even now as I am typing).\\nPersona: It would be probably really funny if you saw me getting a blood test. I always make sure I make good friends with the nurse so she gives me great treatment. Then I exaggerate how I don't like the sight of my blood and I never look to the blood that was drawn from me.\\nPersona: Once I haad a terrible experience. The nurse failed to take my blood like three times, the vein 'didn't work' or smth, no blood was coming. You can imagine how I felt.\\nPersona: But the blood tests are not really a big issue, not even an issue. The worst part is that I can never get myself to donate blood. My friends do it regularly and I always skip, cause I would not be able to live with the fact that I have less blood, even if it's temporary. In my mind I am like imagining air gaps in the blood vessels, as there is not enough blood to fill whole volume.\\nPersona: I don't even remember the plot. All I can remember that this kid killed the cat and the word 'Kliud\u017eiau\" was kind of ironic and it became a joke around lithuanian students.\\nPersona: about that ^\\nPersona: Yeah. I watched the film called \"The Turin Horse\"\\nPersona: It was once of kind film\\nPersona: It was basically an moving picture of meaninglessnes\\nPersona: This review summarizes the film really well\\nPersona: And it was related to what a horse that Nietzsche saw being beaten.\\nPersona: damn I need to watch this film again\\nFriend: suuuure. careful there or you'll drop your fedora!\\nFriend: omg I know! it's ridiculously addictive\\nFriend: oh no, once you give in to check that one little thing, it's over\\nFriend: it's so useful. idk how the rest of languages managed without it. actually I love all those strange words from different languages describing very very specific phenomena. I don't think we have anything like that\\nFriend: only now it's occurred to me how concerning it is that this dude just casually knew a step-by-step instructions to impalement. bit of a weird flex\\nFriend: although he later got a Nobel prize, so perhaps that's the way\\nFriend: woah what?! that's soo cool. I thought it's just purely sensory, but it looks like there's a pretty complex cognitive process underneath. have you always felt that way?\\nFriend: that's totally understandable. that is a lot of blood\\nFriend: oooh that one. yeah it's been in my periphery for a long time, but I've always been sort of afraid to watch it\\nFriend: for the same reason I've never seen Space Odyssey or The Holy Mountain\\nFriend: because I don't know if I'm able to form an opinion independent of their acclaim. if I like it, is it because of conformism? if I don't, is it because I didn't understand?\\nFriend: I wonder when it's lost those two stars\\nFriend: okay, I suppose this is the end of this conversation\\nFriend: I'm sorry if I unknowingly did something that caused this. regardless, I really enjoyed talking to you and wish you all the best:)\\nFriend: well, inevitably - see you around\\nPersona: no wait"

Notion is really nice for project maagement and has a half amazing half decent table (database) functionality. But for personal wiki I prefer Logseq\\nFriend: Markdown is ez pz\n\nThe usefulness comes from the extensions and those are a bit intimidating\\nPersona: ah okay, I didn't try much extensions\\nPersona: I didn't like obsidian because it has stupid functionality for block references. Its more page based.\\nPersona: And it also has much more primitived block embed functinality (make a editable reference to a block). You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. On Logseq this is possible, fully native, and easy.\\nPersona: Thats the feature I was dreaming about in MindManager for so long\\nPersona: I don't like page based, because a big task in note-taking is deciding where to put what and then deciding where to look for what. If you also need to think about pages, then its an extra variable in your decision making process.\\nPersona: Logseq automates that, so any single block can be a page, you just press on it to zoom in and it becomes the root element\\nPersona: But they also have pages (which is sometimes till needed so files don't get too large and if you want to collaborate, so you can work in diff files, like in coding)\\nPersona: The only issue with Logseq is that its less stable and feels a little weirder and less polished than Obsidian. Obsidian is super smooth\\nPersona: Next semester I will try switching uni notes to Logseq, but I am a little anxious. There will be many improvements with that - like I can't wait till I can use block embeds, also I will be able to share my notes with other people in a standardized format. Search functionality is better too.\\nPersona: But I am anxious that the mindmap layout presentation will turn out to be much more superior to bullet list presentation when it comes to complex topics I will study. Also in Logseq there is less options for content visual customization, so making things standout is more limited (bolding, colors still work).\\nPersona: bruuug sweet\\nPersona: you look good\\nFriend: Thanks man\nWas a good time\\nFriend: I'm happy she wants to show me\\nFriend: Was thinking some days before that ppl post on diff social media diff side of them and was wondering if she will just want her own photos on instagram\\nFriend: Or would she show me\\nFriend: Cause ive heard a lot instagram is more for dating kind of\\nFriend: What are block embeds\\nFriend: Yeah.. i want some way to combine mindmanager mindmaps with note app\\nPersona: ig is general purpose social media\\nPersona: i dont think it has much specialization like linkedin which is for professionals\\nPersona: almost everykind of businness has ig profile these days\\nPersona: I think instsgram is good for dating, but its the same as saying 'a car is good for dating'. Ita good but its not made for it specifically\\nPersona: You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. \n\nobj_A = Object()\n\nobj_A.var1 = \"hello\"\nobj_A2 = obj_A\nobj_A2.var1 = \"world\"\nprint(obj_A.var1) // \"world\"\\nPersona: thats prob best way to explain it\\nPersona: its like a mirror reference thats editable\\nPersona: mindmanager is so bad for integrations\\nFriend: They have that?\n\nWhere does the real obj live\nIs one original and other are references\\nFriend: Huh\nYoutube-like?\\nFriend: But with photos\\nPersona: I will show you later\\nPersona: bro do you really have no idea how instragram is used?\\nPersona: Its not like youtube in many ways. Its just very general. Less general than facebook, but fb has just became too general for the new times\\nPersona: you post updates about what you do, about your interests, show off some aesthetic you capture, show off the imagine of yourself you are creating, show your hobbies maybe, show your personality in reel, photos, stories\\nPersona: I mostly use it to see what my friends, aquantainces are up to. Maybe get inspired. I also use it to build a digital.image of myself, to already be able to show some of who I am without needing to meet someone, so I try to look nice, cool, happy (fot girls and for overall status). Then I use it for entertainment regarding reels. And for chatting with anyone. I also follow some business accounts\\nPersona: my fav part is the stories. Its a wonderful conversation starter\\nPersona: like I see soneone do smth then if I meet them or on story reply I inquire\\nPersona: I think you shluld use it more if you want more social\\nPersona: realllly good\\nFriend: Ooh\nI've seen this one\n\nAnnoying to work with business people that don't try to understand how to communicate\\nFriend: I am reading a book about UX designers communicating but i think it might be handy for any profession\\nFriend: I can do a summary when i read it\\nFriend: Maybe I can start by just observing what you and people put there? \nMight need some guidance when i start posting \ud83e\udde0\\nPersona: this chick is in game development"

All scrapers like BS4, lxml, Scrapy only work with HTML type data\\nPersona: Fuck selenium\\nPersona: I may only use it when I need to click buttons\\nFriend: if that js is embeded in the html, then you can do it by parsing the string\\nPersona: what do you mean parsing the string\\nFriend: when you make a request to fetch the page, you get back a string\\nPersona: Oh yeah thats what I did\\nPersona: But I don;t need to interpret the JS\\nFriend: damn :D so that's how you get each page in a second now\\nFriend: exactly! Nice :D\\nPersona: Actually i could make it faster, The bottleneck is the download time of the page\\nPersona: it takes 90% of the 1 second the download the apge\\nPersona: Regex function in the 780 000 char long HTML takes roughly 0.05 - 0.1 seconds\\nPersona: And I am sure there is a way to download multiple pages at the same time, leaving as least idle CPU time as possible\\nFriend: do you remember if async.io worked for you?\\nFriend: cause this article looks relevant\n\nthey show first the sync way and then how to do things async\\nPersona: yeah it worked when I tried it again\\nPersona: I already quickly found a way how to use anyc with requests so all good :D\\nPersona: I am hyped to being implementing this fully, cuz that was just test runs :D Yet I have some other work now with the case and stuff\\nPersona: But it felt like an 'eureka' thing xdddddddd\\nFriend: :D I want to see how fast your baby will go\\nPersona: yeah, I'll give you a demo when I am finished\\nFriend: there is some proper user experience here :D not having to wait 10 days to get back a new playlist\\nPersona: xdddddddddd\\nPersona: oh yeah, the current methods takes 50 seconds for like 4 videos in a playlist\\nPersona: but that will change very soon\\nFriend: http://ceepr.mit.edu/files/papers/2015-007.pdf\\nFriend: http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/search/basic?vid=1&sid=f658bc0c-7f43-4c46-a2f4-5121f32fb63d%40pdc-v-sessmgr01\\nFriend: and\\nPersona: 10.1111/1467-923x.00125\\nPersona: 10.1080/09644016.2015.1023579\\nFriend: Hey Airi!

I was also shocked when I read it. I had no idea it's this bad\\nPersona: I pretty sure he was not on drugs. He doesnt do drugs afaik, I even offered him to do weed, he always refused\\nPersona: Maybe its because his wife wasnt around and she is usually around at parties with him\\nPersona: btw sorry I was on a hurry busy today since I woke up\\nPersona: I called him in the morning (by definition afternoon)\\nPersona: so sober talk\\nPersona: He might have not realised the situation, since he said sorry to you, but told me to not say sorry to Gustav \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: in the post it says he chased people with \"homemade flamethower\".

Denis has just accidentally earned himself a status of a legend of this dorm\\nFriend: I don't think there has been an incident like that since the times of armed break ins\\nPersona: on that scale it would sit exatcly at level of my aunts can of white spray\\nPersona: which in some ways could causr more terror and destructive damage than Elon Musks version\\nFriend: oh\\nFriend: that's...creative\\nPersona: Random, but are you still living upstairs or moved out? \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Jesus christ, I forgot\\nFriend: are you okay? is it really bad at yours?\\nFriend: yes, it's me. my faucet burst fucking open at 7 in the morning\\nFriend: sorry, I didn't check with you earlier. I'm trying to organize 1000 things rn\\nPersona: dont worry about it in terms of me\\nPersona: sorry I had to reply was, was on the go\\nPersona: tbh michael was more annoying than any of the few drops that made it to me \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: He knocked so hars very early in the morning, then he called me\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: fun until you get a stab in your finger I guesss\\nPersona: But since I don't need the extra fingers...\\nPersona: darts with knives I imagine is kinda hrd\\nPersona: hard*\\nFriend: oh good point. didn't think about that. well, you just need proper mittens\\nFriend: it was! and the target is above the fridge, which doesn't help at all\\nPersona: yeah if by proper you kean kevlar or steel \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: how badly did you destroy the fridge?\\nFriend: of course I went to google to check if it's a thing\\nFriend: turns out we were wrong\\nFriend: you just need to read a book\\nFriend: as you may know, this is a recurring game in 10.2 and the average is 2 holes per match, I would say. thank gods for magnets\\nPersona: I already like ir from the tagline ahah\\nPersona: even more\\nPersona: Holy shit xdd You put magnets to cover the holes. Thats so smart, but it still does not cancel out the stupid decision to place the board above fridgea\\nPersona: I need to see this fridge though \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: two ungoogable questions that are going to torment me now is how many copies did they sell and whether that single positive review was placed by the author themselves or rather their family member\\nFriend: coincidentally, in the Christmas package my parents sent me 2 fridge magnets. seemed strange at the time, but I think they know me better than I'd like to admit\\nFriend: no no, it's not a board, it's a thermobox so you don't really have that many options at an appropriate height\\nPersona: I will buy a copy and post a review. So then you will know atleast 50% of the truth\\nPersona: oh wow\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: The more I know the wilder it seems\\nFriend: it's just more embarrassing now, because thermobox is a fairly large target\\nFriend: please do\\nPersona: but you have like different areas for different points, right?\\nFriend: .........yeah, sure, totally\\nPersona: try the cutlery apple game next time. You might lose some neighbours, but atleast the fridge will be alright\\nPersona: idk if its called that but my friend kept screaming that phrase\\nPersona: I bought 1L of fireball in duty free xd\\nPersona: btw the piernikowe ciastko is really good\\nFriend: haha kudos to your friend for being able to pronounce cutlery correctly while intoxicated. even multiple times. very impressive\\nFriend: I have no idea what this is, but looks scary\\nFriend: you think so? I had one as well, and mine was sooo dry \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: is it that hard though? I should try to say it next time when I am\\nPersona: I drank it only once from my latvian colleagues on a work party. But I kinda forgot my impression on it. I just remember that the next morning during team building session the whole baltic team was chanting fireball from time to time\\nPersona: I guess the conclusions is that it  strenghtens team relationships xd\\nPersona: actually the best part of it was that it was soo soft\\nFriend: I don't know, but it's doesn't look mumble-friendly at all. when you're at it, try 'squirrel' as well, because that's how I discovered that this word is unpronounceable\\nFriend: well, I hope it was happy chanting and not screams of regret then\\nFriend: on the other hand, pain brings people together too\\nFriend: maybe I just got some weird speciman. glad you liked it \u263a\ufe0f\\nPersona: Are you drilling some holes ir your kitchen? xddd\\nPersona: hm okay, I 'll add it to my now 'try when drunk' list\\nPersona: for me the hardest one is 'masculinity'\\nPersona: it was pretty happy. I am in pursuit of that happiness by buying a whole litre\\nPersona: Evidently yes, but I have some unattractive feeling about such relationships\\nPersona: probably, cause mine was perfectly soft, thank you again\\nFriend: I thought it's you! it sounded like the opposite wall to the kitchen one and I don't think it was my other neighbour\\nFriend: what? to me this one seems very friendly. it's the R's for me that make everything fall apart\\nFriend: imagine the heights you could reach if you drank it all at once\\nFriend: you mean in terms of co-dependency or what?\\nPersona: but its also not me, wait I'll check in the kitchen\\nPersona: After drinking all of it at once, all I could probably reach would be my floor \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Sometimes, not all the times of course, when some issue pain connects you to another, the another then may become like an anchor keeping your from solving that issue\\nPersona: But not all the time of course\\nPersona: nope, no traces of drilling\\nPersona: was it your kitchen then?\\nPersona: wanna take a look? xd\\nFriend: doesn't seems so. if it's not your next door neighbour, must be those kitchen ghosts of yours\\nFriend: hahah, maybe that's the road to happiness\\nPersona: but it came from the kitchen side 100%\\nPersona: I really want to try a shot of this, but I cant find an opportunity\\nFriend: nonono, that's debatable. I was sitting pressed against that wall and from my perspective it seemed like the opposite end\\nFriend: just wait till round 3 of drilling. you may need it\\nPersona: hmm maybe, okay, whatever, none of us get to see the home upgrade \ud83d\ude2a\\nPersona: in that case you need it too\\nPersona: I am cold, I need some fireball, oh well!\\nFriend: and - do you feel a sudden urge to chant fireball?\\nPersona: did you just assume that I drank it?\\nPersona: you are right, I did, but I dont think I drank enough to release the secrets\\nFriend: didn't have to. I made that inference based on auditory data coming from my window\\nPersona: oh dear, all sounds of the fire dragons rumbling and the blazing fireballs must have leaked outside\\nPersona: I must apologize if that caused great inconvenience\\nFriend: haha no, you can take apology back. I was working until 4:30 for unrelated reasons, so all sources of free entertainment including sounds of gradually intensifying chaos were very welcome"

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nPersona: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nPersona: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nPersona: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nPersona: This could be huge\\nPersona: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nPersona: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nPersona: thats what I lvoe\\nPersona: love*\\nPersona: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nPersona: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nFriend: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nPersona: no worries I was also slow\\nPersona: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nPersona: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nFriend: And also one in the evening, right?\\nPersona: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nPersona: I literally cant find the email\\nFriend: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nPersona: yeah I agree\\nFriend: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nPersona: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nPersona: my dear love is rejecting me\\nPersona: I think should be not\\nFriend: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nFriend: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nFriend: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nFriend: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nFriend: I'll look\\nFriend: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nPersona: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nPersona: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nFriend: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nFriend: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nPersona: I think Carsten did not reply\\nPersona: Should I send a quick email\\nPersona: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nPersona: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nFriend: Probably a good Idea\\nFriend: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nPersona: He is platforms dude\\nFriend: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nPersona: from him?\\nPersona: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nPersona: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nFriend: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nPersona: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nPersona: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nPersona: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nPersona: cause if not we should get looking\\nPersona: perhaps\\nPersona: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nPersona: we showed we are serious and won him\\nFriend: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nFriend: true\\nPersona: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nPersona: Dude\\nPersona: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nPersona: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nFriend: sounds accurate\\nPersona: wait a sec\\nPersona: I'll show you some gold\\nPersona: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nPersona: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nFriend: U did it again!\\nFriend: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: we can investigate if u have time\\nFriend: Cool. I\u2019m out 4 some food rn. Maybe when I\u2019m back\\nFriend: Will u send me the pic u took 4 me yesterday?\\nFriend: Im back:)\\nPersona: I am at the library but I am so lazy to get up xdd\\nPersona: yh lol I see myself in the pic\\nPersona: Hey, how was Econ? :D\\nPersona: Did you know that you can search all of the linked maps at the same time?\\nPersona: This is an amazing feature\\nFriend: I blanked..:/\\nFriend: My document crashed, and I only saved very early. There was no change I could\u2019ve handed anything in close 2 how well I can perform\\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this! Gonna use this 4 sure, thx!\\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\\nPersona: holy shit\\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nPersona: Definetely!\\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\\nPersona: Hm\\nPersona: interesting, I did not\\nPersona: I should\\nPersona: Thank you\\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\\nPersona: I will check out your too\\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\\nPersona: Im done maaaan\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: Goodluck\\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\\nFriend: How did it go?\\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nPersona: What are PP's?\\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nPersona: is it anki cards?\\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nFriend: no, just from class\\nFriend: So u can command-f\\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\\nFriend: 2 your left\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nPersona: Never thought of that\\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Saunaaaaa\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: Xddd\\nPersona: I sourced I new bike, but that also needs repair, but simplier lol\\nPersona: Lan party nice\\nPersona: Code day nice\\nFriend: Oh bike ride day\\nFriend: Butif it happens winter timr\\nFriend: Are you ok with drifting or bad weather biking\\nFriend: it's 2023\nwoman doesn't want to clean at home anymore\\nPersona: I never tried drifting, alsp idk if my car would be good for that xd\\nPersona: Bad weather biking idk, depends how I fix my bike\\nPersona: XDDDSSDD\\nPersona: wait you got into cbs already?\\nFriend: no no\nnot yet\n\n15th deadline to submit application for masters\\nPersona: ah okay, so the celebration is later\\nPersona: goodluck\\nPersona: It should work out\\nPersona: WHich one are you applying for?\\nFriend: Digital business\\nPersona: 100% decided/\\nPersona: ?\\nFriend: Only they have winter intake\\nFriend: I'll probably try to apply to the other master when the time comes\\nPersona: ohh you are going winter intake\\nFriend: otherwise I have half year gap\nmight start asap\\nPersona: The first semester you will do C#\\nPersona: my colleague just started Digital Business\\nFriend: Easy\\nPersona: Should be for you\\nPersona: I am so used to piracy I am pirating Office instead of getting the legit one that CBS provides its students\\nPersona: Legit one from Microsoft is more sus than cracked one at this point\\nFriend: cbs provided expires\\nFriend: and yeah you dont know whats hidden in legit\\nPersona: yeah thats the actual reason\\nPersona: not the sus part. You got me\\nPersona: but every joke has some truth\\nPersona: Its so hard to cract Office tho\\nPersona: cracks just dont work\\nPersona: I need to tell you about the polish chick sometime\\nPersona: stuff happened\\nFriend: new windows super sus btw\nkeeps annoying me with updates\\nFriend: i like cracked with everything disabled\\nFriend: will try to meet you when im free again\\nFriend: I feel like chatgpt personal statements and letters are too posh\\nFriend: if you have some time to read can I get your take\\nFriend: I don't know if it's ok to call the programme BADB or use the full name\n\nI'm trying to save space cause max is 2 pages\\nPersona: call it DB\\nPersona: we call our DM\\nPersona: I can read ir a bit l8er\\nFriend: ok. Thanks!\nRefined version with calling it DB\\nPersona: why is there a random hash in the name?\\nFriend: XD I downloaded it like that\nwill rename\\nFriend: is exchange the same as electives?\\nFriend: I think its different\\nPersona: pretty much\\nPersona: Ok ChatGPT is very Posh at points\\nPersona: I can even tell which parts I assume were writted by ChatGPT and you xd\\nPersona: which is not a bad thing imo, cause using ChatGPT shows some skill in tech\\nPersona: I marked the posh parts pink\\nPersona: and added other comments\\nPersona: green stuff is stuff I liked\\nPersona: but for CBS, which does not allow use of it, may be a bad signal. idk\\nPersona: Hard to tell\\nPersona: It soudns a little insincere at posh parts. But CBS is a business school so life is insincere there generally\\nFriend: thanks for the detailed marking :D\nI feel like this turned out to be a good letter\\nPersona: np\\nPersona: You got this\\nPersona: I am trying to figure out why do I like my job so much. Work days pass so fast, I can't wait to go back.\n\nIn some ways it feels like I am running my own small startup there. I am fully in charge of the Website and partly of the tech stack surrounding it. I build the CMS and there are other people that use it - they are the users and CMS is my product. We all then collaborative build the website. Also, every single task is different and the variety of tasks is extreme. I am a part of the marketing department and I also work with most of other departments, sales, customer team, engineering team (for sparring, or when I use our own product for the website), design team, events. Maybe not the accounting/finance team, but that's fine. I also have extreme freedom in how I choose my tasks and prioritize them. Also, there are much less limits, compared to GROHE in what can be done.\\nPersona: Maybe its just because I worked 2.5 years at GROHE\\nPersona: the contrast is hard. But its been 6mo I am still overwhelmingly happy.\\nPersona: is this the car scary thing?\\nPersona: the page has no text info wtf\\nPersona: I am just taking the piss of Danske bank at this point\\nPersona: Gives me pleasure"

Tried tuning it a bit, changing prompts, but what I got to does not feel like what I would do\\nPersona: Although the last one is not that bad\\nPersona: Give me some text tommorow that you had to read or smth, could be multiple pages and pdf also good, I will run it through so highlight/hide the text.\\nPersona: Dude makes fun tech stories\\nFriend: Yooo\nYou wrote a lot of ai stuff\nHaven't had time to see all\\nPersona: fuck it\\nPersona: if you have time :Dd\\nPersona: then read it, otherwise, can be skipped\\nFriend: Its interesting qhat you found\nCause i wanna try using lang chain to make ai docs\\nFriend: Lol nice\\nFriend: Always slipping\n\nIts like ice skating shoes but for asphalt\\nPersona: Xddd\\nPersona: The artsyles prompt ideas are pretty cool though.

I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager.

At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things.

Is that inhertiance or not\\nFriend: can't remember\\nFriend: if it's not in the menu things, then no\\nFriend: menu classes\\nPersona: its ovveriding, overloading\\nPersona: overriding\\nFriend: based on this I get\\nFriend: using a child by using the parent  class properties\\nPersona: so lets say if class abstract_menu has method display() {matplotlib.show()}\nthe child class main_menu(abstract_menu) has a method display() {print(\"no display for you fuckerrrr\"}\\nPersona: its polymirphism\\nPersona: or\\nPersona: if you define a special class\\nFriend: no, we don't override I think\\nPersona: ah okay\\nPersona: maybe cuz its python\\nFriend: we have 2 menus that inherit from Range_Menu\n\nand on each one of them you call \"prompt\" but prompt is defined on Range_menu (the parent)\\nPersona: I think best langs for learning OOP is Java or C++\\nPersona: yes that nice. thats inheritence. I like it\\nFriend: you can do overriding in python \n\nlet me see something in the ode\\nPersona: In java you can define object of modified classes\\nPersona: Idk if this is possible in Python\\nPersona: but dude nvm. work on important stuff\\nPersona: and also be aware of the 3 OOP features\\nPersona: its a popular computer science question\\nPersona: and if you know about it and they ask, you could win yourself 3 minutes of bs talk\\nFriend: I think we have it! If it's related to overriding\\nPersona: oh really? where\\nFriend: LogLine.py\\nFriend: # how the object prints when it's passed to the str() function\n    def __str__(self):\n        return str(self.date) + \" \" + str(self.windDir) + \" \" + str(self.windSp) + \" \" + str(self.theoPow) + \" \" + str(self.actPow) + \" \" + str(self.error) + \" \" + self.serv + \" \" + self.fault + \" \" + self.stat + \" \" + self.powDiff\n\n    # how the object prints when referenced in an error (helpful when debugging)\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return self.__str__()\\nFriend: every object inherits from the base \"object\" class!\\nFriend: it's not written explicitly but thats default in many languages\\nFriend: so we override the default functions of printing the object\\nFriend: so when it's printed in the console, it would now look differently when printed (because we defined how)\\nFriend: when you do print(line)\nand the line is a LogLine\\nFriend: then magic happens\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: that is polymorphism\\nFriend: nice :D\n\none is for errors and one is for print \nnot sure which is which atm. I just copied it from stack overflow\\nPersona: a cool thing to say in presentation.\\nPersona: We used 2/3 OOP features\\nPersona: maybe we even use encapsulation?\\nPersona: I dont even know if this is possible in Python\\nFriend: that's a little too deep I think\\nFriend: they wouldn't ask you anything that wasn't part of our classes\\nPersona: Wasn't OOP a part of our class?\\nPersona: Okay it may haven't, but its no 1 computer science topic so I expected that ir would xd\\nFriend: it is but we have learned suuper basic stuff\\nFriend: you already know the stuff\n\nthe only thing that coud be a problem I think is if they ask you to point it in the code (not sure they'd do that)\\nPersona: waterfall and interative. what are they again?\\nPersona: methods of what?\\nPersona: like how are they grouped. I forgot xd\\nFriend: 2 different methods of project uuh managment? development\\nFriend: it's a development process!\\nPersona: development process?\\nPersona: nice\\nFriend: check the article\nagile vs iterative\\nFriend: think the most important part (what we argue for too) is that agile, after each iteration your product is working\n\nwhile in iterative, it's not necessary. So you wouldn't be able to run/test your code in production\\nPersona: yeye you expained that clearly a few daysago\\nPersona: will never forget\\nPersona: My biggest fear is if they start asking how parts of the diagrams are called\\nPersona: I call it a rectangle!

It wasn't a lucid dream but a very vivid and realistic one\\nFriend: I don't remember the details as I woke up a few times and got back to sleep but it started at yesterday's work party (it was the same place, same people)\\nFriend: I met a group of people at the party and decided to hang out with them. Long story short, it turned out that they are human traffickers driving a circus car XD\\nFriend: We somehow teleported to a parking lot near my house (it's very dark and sketchy, my friend got jumped there one time irl). They were trying to give me drugs and convince to stay with them so I decided to run away\\nFriend: As I got to my house all of the trees were cut down, sky was red and there were ashes in the air\\nFriend: And that's the weirdest part for me because this scenery looked like a part of a nightmare that I used to have every night a few years ago. That was the only moment where I knew that I'm dreaming because I knew this place so well\\nPersona: interesting\\nPersona: SOOOOO YOU COULD HAVE GONE LUCID\\nPersona: You were so close\\nPersona: Next time you realize you are dreaming, try to control it\\nPersona: like wish for things to happen and do things as if you were 100% certain they will happen\\nFriend: I had to go to work :<\\nFriend: But yeah, next time I'd try\\nFriend: Tbh I think that I had this dream because of yesterday's conversation\\nFriend: Especially the last part hah\\nFriend: Did you sleep well? \ud83e\udd20 Any plans for today?\\nPersona: like think that you have a tommy gun on your back, reach for your back, grab it and you will be surprised you have it\\nPersona: then shoot all fhe druggies\\nPersona: and if you ever get overwhelmed, just image that you have called air support strike from the airforce and they will come in a second and nuke the villains\\nPersona: sleep well. Study study study\\nPersona: I will study almost whole august, no going out with friends. Just one party that I aggreed to come a while ago and I honor the person\\nFriend: Oh wow, that's extremely specific. Not sure if I'll manage to do that, will try my best \ud83d\ude4f\\nFriend: Do you have your uni + work schedule for September?\\nPersona: Its just an example, but overall it has to be specific in a lucid dream to control it\\nPersona: Okay so I just checked and work + school will pretty much make me busy from 8 to 17 every workday on September\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So my mindmaps are quite messy, yet the beeuty of mindmapping is that even if its messy its still quite comprehensive and memorable and easy to manage\\nPersona: I am getting some examplef for you\\nPersona: Its the best if you have all the info for one project close togetehr\\nPersona: so if you have hardware development > LED\nand then somewhere 100+ topics away: Prices > LED\\nPersona: it would be very unconvienint\\nPersona: it would be better for \"Project LED\" > Hardware development\n \"Project LED\" > Prices\\nPersona: so you dont need to go back and forth and if you do make links\\nPersona: however, in stuff where you learn from book, everything is categorized, so there I prefer to do some generalization\\nPersona: This one is quite general, but i have one called 'Project\" where I put everything for one video job\\nPersona: and also good tip\\nPersona: Have a subtopic \"irrelevent\"\\nPersona: this is like archive\\nPersona: for same level notes, just not relevent atm\\nFriend: I can't wait to make a big map to show you when I'm ready :D\\nFriend: this is so cool\\nFriend: I need to change my colors like you too\\nFriend: do you put a lot of pics? Do you know if it takes up resources if you have a lot of pics (but they are hidden)\\nFriend: I hope it makes a 'link' to the pic instead of saving it with the map\\nPersona: I like to color smth when its a) important b) out of level order, but kept there just temporary as its super important\\nPersona: Like the yellow \"SPRINT\" is out of order, but because its so relevant atm I keep it here\\nFriend: ooh those are 2 different maps\\nPersona: also, striving for max organization is just way too time consuming. My mindset is - keep it agile\\nPersona: I sorry I can;t send you whole maps, cuz I don't want to share all of the stuff in it hehe\\nPersona: they may have log in info and stuff\\nFriend: yeah no problem :O\nPretty cool to see you keep meeting notes on it\n\nNot sure if I'll go that in depth. Maybe\\nFriend: the fuck is a Matte Latte\\nPersona: A project I was a part of\\nPersona: until I partly quit because lack of time\\nPersona: I was selling copywriting\\nPersona: I also use mindmapping for film analysis\\nPersona: bbut this is quite flawed\\nPersona: as you see the generalization leaves some subtopics empty mostly\\nPersona: because you don't need to note everything\\nFriend: daaamn that's detailed\n\nthe whole map is fight club?\\nPersona: Also, important tip: Leave atleast one topic for uncategorized stuff like \"Ideas\", \"Random\", that you can write in without categorizing initially\\nPersona: A have a template for film analysis I just copy the structure\\nFriend: ok. Then do you have all film maps in a film map folder?\\nFriend: that's like an upper level map  :D\\nPersona: this is my biggest analysis for a film\\nFriend: that's the whole script o_o\\nPersona: Kind of a\\nPersona: I have a mmmap filmaking\\nPersona: But its no related to individual analysis, maybe some elements\\nFriend: is your manager UI dark too btw?\\nPersona: no its white, I like it white :D\\nPersona: I can send you design templats if you want to\\nPersona: I have perfected darm tempaltes\\nPersona: green, red, blue, orange and pink\\nFriend: darm?\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: one template please\\nPersona: YEah picks usually take a lot of visual space, yet I haven't experience performance drops when they are hidden. The only performance drop is the save file time\\nPersona: this one is for java\\nPersona: This is my best mindmap I think. Its for my high school economics\\nPersona: it has many graphs also\\nFriend: thanks a bunch!\nI'll go fetch some sleep but I'm def. continuing on a mindmap quest tomorrow nigh\\nPersona: yeah sure\\nPersona: I am glad you are intesrested xd\\nPersona: Because most people ger the impression that its to confusing when I show them\\nPersona: get*\\nFriend: no way. I've been daydreaming for a mind map. I had these visual ideas in my head of a 3d mindmap. That had cross linked content. So if you open a video, the video player would be \"conected\" or I guess now I can imagine it better, it would have a mind-map plugin\n\nso you'd be able to reference timestamps to a place in a map\n\nand places in a map to a video or a piece of a vid\n\nand being able to have a plugin for everything to integrate with the mindmap\\nFriend: so you can mindmap your whole existence :D\\nFriend: seeing YOU do it in 2d.. close enough to my dream\\nPersona: extacly, make a mindmap \"My Life\" and set a password to it :D\\nPersona: thats what I did\\nPersona: A mindmap for my whole life, pass encrypted of course\\nPersona: Also I have some AHK scripts to set task icons\\nPersona: I will share later, now get used to it xdd\\nPersona: I don't want to interrupt your discovery too much\\nFriend: Nicee! I'll bug you some day when I get accustomed to making maps\\nPersona: When you feel you want the themes I use, the custom icons I have and some AHK scrips, tell me\\nFriend: night night Airi!\\nPersona: goodnight\\nPersona: If you decide to come back on Jan, tell me, we will go meet and code some projects :D\\nPersona: I tried to scrape yt with google sheets :DDDD"

Is that inhertiance or not\\nFriend: can't remember\\nFriend: if it's not in the menu things, then no\\nFriend: menu classes\\nPersona: its ovveriding, overloading\\nPersona: overriding\\nFriend: based on this I get\\nFriend: using a child by using the parent  class properties\\nPersona: so lets say if class abstract_menu has method display() {matplotlib.show()}\nthe child class main_menu(abstract_menu) has a method display() {print(\"no display for you fuckerrrr\"}\\nPersona: its polymirphism\\nPersona: or\\nPersona: if you define a special class\\nFriend: no, we don't override I think\\nPersona: ah okay\\nPersona: maybe cuz its python\\nFriend: we have 2 menus that inherit from Range_Menu\n\nand on each one of them you call \"prompt\" but prompt is defined on Range_menu (the parent)\\nPersona: I think best langs for learning OOP is Java or C++\\nPersona: yes that nice. thats inheritence. I like it\\nFriend: you can do overriding in python \n\nlet me see something in the ode\\nPersona: In java you can define object of modified classes\\nPersona: Idk if this is possible in Python\\nPersona: but dude nvm. work on important stuff\\nPersona: and also be aware of the 3 OOP features\\nPersona: its a popular computer science question\\nPersona: and if you know about it and they ask, you could win yourself 3 minutes of bs talk\\nFriend: I think we have it! If it's related to overriding\\nPersona: oh really? where\\nFriend: LogLine.py\\nFriend: # how the object prints when it's passed to the str() function\n    def __str__(self):\n        return str(self.date) + \" \" + str(self.windDir) + \" \" + str(self.windSp) + \" \" + str(self.theoPow) + \" \" + str(self.actPow) + \" \" + str(self.error) + \" \" + self.serv + \" \" + self.fault + \" \" + self.stat + \" \" + self.powDiff\n\n    # how the object prints when referenced in an error (helpful when debugging)\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return self.__str__()\\nFriend: every object inherits from the base \"object\" class!\\nFriend: it's not written explicitly but thats default in many languages\\nFriend: so we override the default functions of printing the object\\nFriend: so when it's printed in the console, it would now look differently when printed (because we defined how)\\nFriend: when you do print(line)\nand the line is a LogLine\\nFriend: then magic happens\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: that is polymorphism\\nFriend: nice :D\n\none is for errors and one is for print \nnot sure which is which atm. I just copied it from stack overflow\\nPersona: a cool thing to say in presentation.\\nPersona: We used 2/3 OOP features\\nPersona: maybe we even use encapsulation?\\nPersona: I dont even know if this is possible in Python\\nFriend: that's a little too deep I think\\nFriend: they wouldn't ask you anything that wasn't part of our classes\\nPersona: Wasn't OOP a part of our class?\\nPersona: Okay it may haven't, but its no 1 computer science topic so I expected that ir would xd\\nFriend: it is but we have learned suuper basic stuff\\nFriend: you already know the stuff\n\nthe only thing that coud be a problem I think is if they ask you to point it in the code (not sure they'd do that)\\nPersona: waterfall and interative. what are they again?\\nPersona: methods of what?\\nPersona: like how are they grouped. I forgot xd\\nFriend: 2 different methods of project uuh managment? development\\nFriend: it's a development process!\\nPersona: development process?\\nPersona: nice\\nFriend: check the article\nagile vs iterative\\nFriend: think the most important part (what we argue for too) is that agile, after each iteration your product is working\n\nwhile in iterative, it's not necessary. So you wouldn't be able to run/test your code in production\\nPersona: yeye you expained that clearly a few daysago\\nPersona: will never forget\\nPersona: My biggest fear is if they start asking how parts of the diagrams are called\\nPersona: I call it a rectangle! ITS UML. ITS SUBJECTIVE\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Lets call after I finish eating\\nPersona: Should we call?\\nFriend: i am boarding my plane in 10 minutes\\nFriend: so if we can do it in 10 then yes\\nPersona: :DDD\\nPersona: where are you flying woah?\\nFriend: from Aalborg to Cph\\nFriend: i am going home\\nPersona: Inside courtry flight\\nPersona: damn\\nFriend: yes\\nPersona: there is no such thing in Lithuania\\nPersona: when do you properly available?\\nPersona: like with a computer and stuff?\\nPersona: we can also meet, work on the analysis together\\nPersona: Maybe thats easier\\nFriend: this weekend has sucked all the life out of me i am so tired\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: oh dear\\nPersona: the weekend has barely started\\nPersona: well its halfway\\nFriend: we can meet tomorrow would that be good ok?\\nFriend: i will read up on the freaking framing analysis that is confusing me\\nFriend: and then we can do it together tomorrow?\\nPersona: Yeah lets do that\\nFriend: i feel like when we start writing it will take us max 4-5 hours in total\\nFriend: okkk\\nPersona: but I am not sure what you mean the change to framing analysis, so you gotta tell me about that\\nPersona: Cause the analysis that I am doing sort of sort of is starting to make sense\\nPersona: And for me its also pretty clear on what you have to do\\nPersona: In terms of determining their comms strategy\\nFriend: i think we need an analysis model to follow or whatever you call it\\nPersona: Okay go fly, we talk tommorow haha \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: I don't think we need that neccesserily, but yeah we talk tommorow or whenever you are rested and available\\nFriend: look at this tiny ass plane\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing"

Mostly donkeys and Muffalos\\nPersona: I made much more armor and now I am able to arm my colonist before every fight pretty well. Also build a nice place for regilious ritual, but there is still some things I need to figure out regarding that.\\nPersona: Tried growing various foods from the mod, and I learned what kind of advantages they all have. Like soups make sick ppl heal faster.\\nPersona: Had many brutal raid with around 7-9 armed enemies mounting horses attacking me multiple times. Sometimes they make inside the perimeter, but nobody so far penetrated the fort and the keep. My archers shoot the footmen, while my swords and pike men try to flank the enemy archers.\\nPersona: I expanded my keep which also now has its own defense features independent of the fort, but the perimeter wall now has two layers at some points, so its already overkill. I am building another building - an inn to host all of my colonist in separate rooms. But thats on the way later. My biggest issues is getting new colonists and finding some rare items, such as research schematics and some magical minerals that can  cool down or heat up rooms.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: wanna go to christiantown, get some?\\nFriend: Actually I was thinking about going there\\nFriend: I still owe you for last time, aren't I?\\nPersona: lets go?\\nPersona: I am in norebro\\nFriend: Cool, let's meet next to the station in 15?\\nPersona: bike or not?\\nFriend: I can bike\\nPersona: ok lets bike\\nPersona: im at the station\\nPersona: Are you arriving after midnight ?\\nFriend: Yes, unfortunately yes\\nPersona: Do you know the exact time?\\nFriend: I should be 00:20 in Malaga\\nPersona: I think its best if you get a uber\\nPersona: cause we are not getting a car tonight\\nFriend: Is there in Malaga tho?\\nPersona: yea yeah, we took a uber ourselves\\nFriend: Perfecto\\nPersona: this was the song :Dd\\nFriend: Looool\\nFriend: Xdxd\\nPersona: hey bud, if you are going to a store, can you get a monster and a bunch cola cans? :D\\nFriend: I'll be going to a store after arriving at Tobi's place, since I'll have a bag full of Bumbi hah so will take care bout it afterwards \ud83e\udd19\\nPersona: alright, thanks :D\\nFriend: Yo mate, are you gonna arrive straight here?\\nFriend: Cause I still wasn't in the shop lol\\nPersona: yeah, just left home\\nPersona: I can just hit rema on the way if you are not planning to go to shop\\nFriend: Okay, so if you stop by, can you buy me 6pack of some beers?

Cause we had exam out of it, so if you want a 10, its not a choice then\\nPersona: Nietche is fine for me personally, but I'll take the rant I have written and chose to omit from before about the hunger artist\\nPersona: The hunger artist is about a man, I think Kafka himself, who starved himself to death, because he had a disease that made it too painful to eat.\\nPersona: That may make me sound superficial, but since I read that book, I have grown so many fears. That pain could be such big physical pain that existing would be worse than non-existing. That fear is really not good for me. Everytime I get some weird unexplainable pain in for example joints, I am like \"faaak I will be The Not Moving Artist\" or if I get some random numbness I will be like \"The Paralyzed Artist\". That is making me too worried and scared of life.\\nPersona: Of course, it's a tradeoff, cause if that causes me to take fewer risks, I may overall ensure higher well-being and safety, but too much fear and risk-aversion can lead to the slowing of progress. And honestly I feel like I am not doing and risk-taking enough.\\nPersona: So I would have preferred to never know about it. I know that makes me sound terrible and superficial, cause I refuse to know about suffering and suffering is such a virtuous quality and yada yada\\nFriend: haha based on popularity of reddit book-based bots, thus may be a goldmine. I'd be surprised though if nobody has done anything similar yet\\nFriend: yeaaah, that one sounds rough and not really necessary. what was that supposed to teach you?\\nFriend: I sympathize, had read my fair share of graphic war-related stuff and medical stuff\\nFriend: actually, I'm impressed with literature you guys get at school, because our whole curriculum was Polish books about farmers. and war. and farmers going to war (to spice it up)\\nFriend: I still think that forcing people to read Nietzsche at school is a smart move, even for the reasons you stated. I think usually people reach for those works when they are down and alone, and therefore more susceptible to that philosophy, as it seems to confirm what they already believe. by deconstructing it in a class environment, you get inputs from people of opposing views, you are shown the weak points and so on\\nPersona: you lurk in Reddit? \ud83d\ude2e\\nPersona: I dont know actually. We never deeply discussed it, just got an intro and summary\\nPersona: ughh medical stuff. I cant take. I once was in blood testing lab for a school excursion and I didnt even see blood I almost fainted. But it was fine afterwards cause they gave me candy\\nPersona: Also its weird cause I can easily murder people in video games full of gore and dont care. I always get freaked out about my own blood.\\nPersona: Maybe its because I has internstional program. But we had some lithuanian literature. The iconis one is \"Kliud\u017eiau\" where a kid shoots a cat. Kliud\u017eiau means smth like \"got in to the way\"\\nPersona: But I mostlt liked international. I wrote a nice essay about Doolhouse\\nPersona: actually its a play by henrik ibsen\\nPersona: I agree that its nice if they show the weak points of those philosophies. Also, what do you think depressed people really do in modern times? Do they really resort to reading philosophical books?\\nFriend: oh lord, Reddit raised me. the damage has been done. and sealed. I just thank the gods I was too young to experience 4chan\\nFriend: so just to suffer. I think there are some horrifying things previous generations had to read and now they get a bit of schadenfreude from watching kids go through the same torture\\nFriend: of maybe that's a Polish thing\\nFriend: because we have at least one of those\\nFriend: there's this classic from 17th century I had to read when I was 12. and there (spoiler!) a bad guy gets impaled (?) or whatever the English term for that is\\nFriend: my parents were very amused while watching me getting traumatized\\nFriend: oooo I have questions!\\nFriend: I never meet people like that, because everyone in the medical field is so desensitized\\nFriend: okay games, but what about movies?\\nFriend: or documentaries?\\nFriend: and is it different when it's somebody else's blood compared to yours?\\nFriend: and does it have to be actively drawn or if it's just chilling somewhere it's also bad?\\nFriend: for sociopathic fun or...?\\nFriend: the title sounds familiar, but idk if it's because it's uncharacteristic or I've actually heard it. was there some big film based on it?\\nFriend: I think few people read the whole book, most likely they just come across some catchphrases taken out of context, which is even worse\\nPersona: impossibl. I thought hot girls like you don't use reddit\\nPersona: But I am a redditor too, although I deleted the app recently cause I started spending to much time scrolling in silly subs\\nPersona: I have recently revised the museum of reddit subreddit, so got back into it a bit\\nPersona: holy shit this word, we were all fascinated about it in English class I remember, it was the main troll joke of our English class for a year. Even teacher was on it.\\nPersona: but eh I don't think so that was the case in my class. Our literature teacher was the best mix of everything. I enjoyed doing analysis in her classes so much.\\nPersona: Damn they make you read this and then say video games cause violence. Unacceptable\\nPersona: Yes. Bingo\\nPersona: To this ^\\nPersona: And bingo number two kinda\\nPersona: You asked the right questions\\nPersona: Basically I only feel uncomfortable when my blood is involved in the situation. But this is also a bit complex. I would not mind seeing my blood like chilling somewhere, so a finger cut that I quickly cover does not bother me at all. So to be prescise, its the fact of knowing that I have less blood now that bothers me. As soon as I think some blood is drawn from me I start to feel shivers (even now as I am typing).\\nPersona: It would be probably really funny if you saw me getting a blood test. I always make sure I make good friends with the nurse so she gives me great treatment. Then I exaggerate how I don't like the sight of my blood and I never look to the blood that was drawn from me.\\nPersona: Once I haad a terrible experience. The nurse failed to take my blood like three times, the vein 'didn't work' or smth, no blood was coming. You can imagine how I felt.\\nPersona: But the blood tests are not really a big issue, not even an issue. The worst part is that I can never get myself to donate blood. My friends do it regularly and I always skip, cause I would not be able to live with the fact that I have less blood, even if it's temporary. In my mind I am like imagining air gaps in the blood vessels, as there is not enough blood to fill whole volume.\\nPersona: I don't even remember the plot. All I can remember that this kid killed the cat and the word 'Kliud\u017eiau\" was kind of ironic and it became a joke around lithuanian students.\\nPersona: about that ^\\nPersona: Yeah. I watched the film called \"The Turin Horse\"\\nPersona: It was once of kind film\\nPersona: It was basically an moving picture of meaninglessnes\\nPersona: This review summarizes the film really well\\nPersona: And it was related to what a horse that Nietzsche saw being beaten.\\nPersona: damn I need to watch this film again\\nFriend: suuuure. careful there or you'll drop your fedora!\\nFriend: omg I know! it's ridiculously addictive\\nFriend: oh no, once you give in to check that one little thing, it's over\\nFriend: it's so useful. idk how the rest of languages managed without it. actually I love all those strange words from different languages describing very very specific phenomena. I don't think we have anything like that\\nFriend: only now it's occurred to me how concerning it is that this dude just casually knew a step-by-step instructions to impalement. bit of a weird flex\\nFriend: although he later got a Nobel prize, so perhaps that's the way\\nFriend: woah what?! that's soo cool. I thought it's just purely sensory, but it looks like there's a pretty complex cognitive process underneath. have you always felt that way?\\nFriend: that's totally understandable. that is a lot of blood\\nFriend: oooh that one. yeah it's been in my periphery for a long time, but I've always been sort of afraid to watch it\\nFriend: for the same reason I've never seen Space Odyssey or The Holy Mountain\\nFriend: because I don't know if I'm able to form an opinion independent of their acclaim. if I like it, is it because of conformism? if I don't, is it because I didn't understand?\\nFriend: I wonder when it's lost those two stars\\nFriend: okay, I suppose this is the end of this conversation\\nFriend: I'm sorry if I unknowingly did something that caused this. regardless, I really enjoyed talking to you and wish you all the best:)\\nFriend: well, inevitably - see you around\\nPersona: no wait"

Tried tuning it a bit, changing prompts, but what I got to does not feel like what I would do\\nPersona: Although the last one is not that bad\\nPersona: Give me some text tommorow that you had to read or smth, could be multiple pages and pdf also good, I will run it through so highlight/hide the text.\\nPersona: Dude makes fun tech stories\\nFriend: Yooo\nYou wrote a lot of ai stuff\nHaven't had time to see all\\nPersona: fuck it\\nPersona: if you have time :Dd\\nPersona: then read it, otherwise, can be skipped\\nFriend: Its interesting qhat you found\nCause i wanna try using lang chain to make ai docs\\nFriend: Lol nice\\nFriend: Always slipping\n\nIts like ice skating shoes but for asphalt\\nPersona: Xddd\\nPersona: The artsyles prompt ideas are pretty cool though. And combining them is nice\\nPersona: Good for making steam, forum avatars\\nPersona: What do you use for notetaking?\\nFriend: Notion is the shit imo\\nFriend: Used it during internship\\nFriend: Have a journal there\\nFriend: And anything that has a time i try to immediately put in the calendar so i can keep track of life\\nPersona: I been experimenting with notion for a while and idk, it does not stick to me\\nPersona: Whole day I was researching note taking apps\\nPersona: I feel it takes very long to make notes in Notion and having everything on many pages, things get lost and navigation takes time.\\nPersona: Also I like the toggleable bullet list approach that MindManager for example uses\\nPersona: Its hard for me to write in paragraph style\\nPersona: I am experimenting with Obsidian and Logseq\\nPersona: Obsidian is super cool, but its paragraph style\\nPersona: Loqseq is bullet point style\\nPersona: I watched note-taking, seconds brain apps for whole video and there was no mention of Mindmanager\\nPersona: I might be too uses to it now, its really hard to switch. I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\\nPersona: yo wtf\\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\\nPersona: click the three dots\\nPersona: and there is install app button\\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\\nPersona: thats pretty cool\\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\\nPersona: and mortgages\\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\\nPersona: this is from a book\\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\\nPersona: And things get interesting then\\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\\nPersona: but hmm\\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\\nFriend: to help you get there?\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\\nPersona: Need to fix that\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: fucking hot, this dude has 20k hours in Dota 2\\nFriend: ah face bad xD\\nPersona: face good\\nFriend: too sharp edges scary for me\\nFriend: but they look good together\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: lol\\nFriend: all these twitter screens are giving me such joy :D\\nFriend: bahaha :D\\nFriend: v\\nFriend: I don't know whats'real anymore :D I love it\\nPersona: lol elon baught twitter for fun\\nPersona: a little toy\\nPersona: Idk this cant be real\\nPersona: did price recover?\\nPersona: I cant do proper networking in parties, I get distracted by females too much\\nFriend: There's light\\nFriend: Made the holes over a year ago xD\\nFriend: Put it up now\\nPersona: damn nice\\nPersona: finally\\nFriend: I showed my guildmate\\nFriend: Idk why this shit funny af\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: not funny af, but funny\\nPersona: This hot girl in my group in todays call was surprisngly smart. I am impressex. Almost curiuos how she will work throughout the project xd\\nPersona: Fuck I am starting to feel the hedonic threadmill again\\nPersona: today I feel low, cause yesterday was so good. The relative difference to a normal day\\nFriend: Idk if you figured how to handle it\nIf not I got a good talk about that\\nFriend: Can I ask you for the wall drill to borrow\\nFriend: I want to make holes this week if i could\\nFriend: New group?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: Should I ask for it tmmrow?\\nPersona: same\\nPersona: no need, thx, I am good \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: just after party stuff\\nFriend: Whos the hot one? Not victoria?\\nPersona: nah\\nPersona: Mimi\\nPersona: the german one\\nFriend: Yeah :D when does it arrive\\nPersona: Idk if you saw her\\nFriend: Fck man.. germans\\nPersona: Idk, will tell tou when I ask\\nFriend: I feel like eastern europeans dont vibe with them\\nPersona: but you have to give it back in one dag\\nPersona: I dont know much germans\\nPersona: So cant say\\nFriend: yeah \nthursday friday would be reall good if possible\\nPersona: then I ask thursday\\nPersona: cause they dont let it keep for long\\nPersona: I was eating carrots with humus and pork when I realized the meaning of lifw\\nPersona: life*\\nFriend: What is it\\nFriend: I read first you ate carrots with humans\\nPersona: Life as a single concept is an evolutionary optimization function, in which each individual sole purpose is to try to survive, reproduce and give their newborns a head start\\nPersona: This explains everything\\nPersona: *so far\\nPersona: Meaning of life may takr a twist when gene modding gets powerful\\nPersona: Cause literally the only way life can continue to exist is if life is coded to try to reproduce. Mutation is the only way currently to make new gene codes which lead to variation. Survival challenge allows natural selection of more optimal gene codes, therefore its naturally forever optimizing\\nPersona: That explain why we 1) want to fuck 2) take unselfish care of our children\\nPersona: If some individual does noy want to fuck due to gene mutation, they may have a higher fitness score, but that will not be reproduced further\\nPersona: And while the 2nd thing is not as fundamental as the 1st one, selfisly caring for your children is extremely optimal, as species with that gene present significantly incr\u0119ase the chance of their species to continue existing\\nPersona: We therefore are optimized naturally to reproduce\\nPersona: stuff like happiness, art, etc. is just and intermediary\\nPersona: This could be a twist, since the very fundamental.part of reproduction is not neccesary then\\nPersona: probably in some hundreds of year we will not want sex that much\\nPersona: selflessly*\\nPersona: Another question whether there is a meaning to optimizing itself idk\\nPersona: Our lives might be meaningful parts of a meaningless Life optimization function.\\nPersona: bro ignore that, I changed my mind xd\\nFriend: Why\\nFriend: We gotta talk life algorthm some point\\nFriend: Maybe high\nMaybenot"

Now that I'm planning to visit you, I thought that maybe we could combine it and also have a short trip to Paris. Buuut after thoroughly checking the flights etc I decided that it will be too complicated and expensive\\nFriend: I'll leave it for the next year ;)\\nFriend: + Paris is a mess rn, so maybe it's for the better not to go\\nFriend: I didn't want to risk being in the center xd\\nFriend: That's the \"w hour\" - the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprosing\\nFriend: That was my experience of it.

I expanded my perimeter wall by a lot and made the biggest ever livestock just outside of it. I probably had around 20-30 animals at one point. Mostly donkeys and Muffalos\\nPersona: I made much more armor and now I am able to arm my colonist before every fight pretty well. Also build a nice place for regilious ritual, but there is still some things I need to figure out regarding that.\\nPersona: Tried growing various foods from the mod, and I learned what kind of advantages they all have. Like soups make sick ppl heal faster.\\nPersona: Had many brutal raid with around 7-9 armed enemies mounting horses attacking me multiple times. Sometimes they make inside the perimeter, but nobody so far penetrated the fort and the keep. My archers shoot the footmen, while my swords and pike men try to flank the enemy archers.\\nPersona: I expanded my keep which also now has its own defense features independent of the fort, but the perimeter wall now has two layers at some points, so its already overkill. I am building another building - an inn to host all of my colonist in separate rooms. But thats on the way later. My biggest issues is getting new colonists and finding some rare items, such as research schematics and some magical minerals that can  cool down or heat up rooms.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I will prerecord my whole presentation and see if they say something :D\n\nworth the shot\\nPersona: xdddd\\nPersona: idk perhaps\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: Can we make a one big \"Make sure you know...\" doc?\\nPersona: Also can we move everything to one doc. I hate having so many docs?\\nPersona: just have a section for everyting\\nPersona: So a \"Make sure you know...\" section\\nPersona: yo I confused a) with micro.

Otherwise we have failed :D\\nPersona: I remember I had problems calculating free cash flow and I had two numbers for every year. One from Yahoo finance one by e formala. And they were SIGNIFICANRTLY different\\nFriend: XD well.. note it down\nput a comment on the pdf and save it\n\nSo we can think of solutions later\\nPersona: ahh grammar is not going to fuck us up.

I just feel no vibe doing this online\\nPersona: Ahh you mean templates and slide design? :D\\nPersona: what I called uniques is the Desmos show we did or the Jenga thin in The Big Short\\nPersona: making a show\\nFriend: yeah I get it\n\nbut pretty slides can help with that too\\nFriend: I have 3 meme gifs on the start of my presentation so far. Possibly it's really bad but let's see. I'll just add everything in my head and reduce after\\nPersona: I am not a fan of templates. The slides I made that have gotten the most compliments had 0 templates and 0 design elements. \nMy rule is 100% coverage with pictures and pictures must be high res. - helps a lot.\\nPersona: One presentation two years ago inspired me and that changed the way I look at slides for life\\nPersona: memes are cool\\nFriend: :D or you can be like the org teacher\n\njust text\n\neverything you say, on the presentation\\nPersona: hm hm petyo, what about your new fancy mmap tool?\\nPersona: :D\\nFriend: the idea is G and Jan are investors with money.
