You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed"

You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it back a few weeks ago\\nFriend: guess what's the Venn diagram of this and people who've tried wodzionka\\nFriend: but actually it's better that I'd have expected, considering that over 90% is catholic on paper. we're rebels\\nPersona: So we force them to take the wodzionka? How would the ransom note look like?\\nPersona: The infamous shortage was indeed due to my quarterly kong strong procurement round. I suggest you stack up now, cause the my next quarterly round is starting soon.\\nPersona: ok ok, If i too ate wozdzionka I would probably believe in hell, god, 5 second rule,  etc. Clearly explains\\nPersona: Also, would you like to meet this weekend as I am sure our plan to ransom NASA could be discussed in better detail in person? I will make a semi-educated guess there and suggest board games, possibly in a cafe, or maybe a film?\\nFriend: gosh, sorry for that lightning response speed. I've been preoccupied with my studies of wodzionka recipes\\nFriend: no, I've actually been tad busy\\nFriend: oh the idea sounds wonderful, but this is a terrible time. you know, there's a shit ton of work I need to do in the next two weeks, so I'm really tentative with making any definitive plans because I will very likely flake\\nFriend: I haven't quite figured out yet how to make it clear that this is an offer they cannot refuse. do you happen to have some dirt on NASA in your files maybe?\\nFriend: providing you with knowledge on turbo wheelchairs might have been the worst mistake I've ever made then\\nFriend: I almost hate how logical it actually is. because wodzionka was a thing decades ago at the time of food shortages, right? and who believes in heaven, hell and all that? old people\\nPersona: hope its going well with the wodzionka research. vital subject\\nPersona: but I joined your late-response club\\nPersona: Now that I am back to my weekly chilling-at-my-couch-and pretending-I-take-time-to-relax-as-a-normal-person, I can look again into our grand plan\\nPersona: I dont have any particular info to potentially shame NASA, but I think they will be interested in wodzionka powers naturally. Unless of course you know smth yourself, cause its still better to be safe and have smth to press with. Should I write them a proposal?\\nPersona: now with that, watch me sweep Lidl clear of all sugarfree kong strongs, drinks them all in an instant, climb mountain everest, square a circle, solve the halting problem and divide by zero just to be sure\\nPersona: but seriously, I can't last a day at work without consuming that and the drink also makes me feel happy and its cheap\\nPersona: so we are about to make NASA become flat-earth believers?\\nPersona: thats a dissapointment. What are busy with these days?\\nFriend: I can't decide whether I'm more surprised that you are able to fit a couch into your room or that you can chill on it with all that Kong in your system\\nFriend: eh so be it. I suppose if necessary we can always just threaten them with good ol' violence\\nFriend: I don't know, personally I can fall asleep immediately after drinking one but they are cheap indeed\\nFriend: if only we can gain something from it\\nFriend: well, I need to write a thesis\\nPersona: Its a bed that can convert to couch like structure. I would never fit a proper couch, not with my unneccesarily large desk atleast\\nPersona: even with all the kongs I drank, solving halting problem and learning to divide by zero gave me enough existential peace that I can relax anytime\\nPersona: then try the reverse psychology. Drink sleeping pills for energy.\\nPersona: the truth!\\nPersona: do thesis semeter(s) feel more busy than normal?\\nFriend: good for you. you can't run a huge scheme from a small desk\\nFriend: is that why maths people have banned dividing by zero? are they just trying to prevent everybody from having fun?\\nFriend: who said this is the goal. look, with my investment in the coffin I need to get my money's worth\\nFriend: hm I suppose they don't have to, but why play life on the easy mode. with a little bit of procrastination you can easily make them feel very busy very suddenly\\nPersona: yes, cause that would give prople all the answers and therefore stop the infinite existential search for meaning, thus reducing consumption and shrinking the economy\\nPersona: So what do you hold as a proper return on coffeine investment?\\nPersona: Yh, I too seem to choose the hard mode of life. I have a speaking disability, where its hard for me to say 'no'. That really ups the difficulty level\\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\\nFriend: I don't know which group you think I belong to and I can't quite decide which possibility I  find more offensive\\nPersona: wait, so I am not getting my shiny award anymore? \ud83d\ude25\\nPersona: Deal! I wonder what is the exchange rate for crazy pool shots and currency?\\nPersona: So you prefer playing the bad cop then?\\nFriend: not only that. now we're forced to have an awkward 201? Oscars wrong winner moment. you're one slap away from making it into a complete disaster\\nFriend: according to my research, in some recent championship it was 50000$ for a 13-10 score, which leaves as with ~3846$ per a crazy good shot. I can live with that\\nFriend: where's the fun in having a virtuous person as your adversary"

Has as many body parts as a human pretty much with each taking damage separately and impacting the performance of it\\nFriend: holy shit xD that's rimworld or realworld\\nPersona: I also never properly done things with Biotech dlc, its official content so high quolity\\nPersona: it allows gene engineerging, mechanoid building\\nPersona: babies\\nPersona: well I had babies inevitably\\nPersona: but never went into advanced mode with them\\nPersona: there are growrh capsules to speed their growing\\nPersona: As they grow you are able to partially influence their traits, passions\\nPersona: and it you got gene engineering tech, you could gene engineer them to be extra adapted to your environment\\nPersona: then there is also Ideologies. I always play classic style idealogies, but you can get a whole new game if you build, evolve or changr to a different one\\nPersona: f.e. you could be cannibbal slaver\\nPersona: that requires you to have slaves, do executions and consume human meat\\nPersona: (required as in peope will be unhappy and have mental breaks)\\nFriend: oh yeah you said there is canibalism\n\nbut what if you can't find other  people to eat, do you have to make babies and eat your own ppl\\nPersona: you would also be benefitted from having blood, skulls visible everywhere\\nPersona: xdd, I think you can still eat other food in a pinch\\nFriend: ah\\nPersona: but you can raid other bases\\nFriend: eww.. food xD\\nPersona: and eat them\\nPersona: lol\\nPersona: but canibalistic meme is just one of many\\nPersona: there is like a meme (ideology trait) that says blindness is sacred\\nPersona: so basically you fo ceremononies whete you remove eyes of your own colonists\\nPersona: and then everyone lives blind\\nPersona: so you would have to resort to melee combat, animal etc to fight for you I guess. Or build turrets\\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute. If they unfreeeze for a while, say a raid penetrates your base or a unaticipated heatwave heats it up, you will get poluttion in your map and it could be a lot you will need hazmat gear to just survive and clean it up.\\nPersona: you could send the pollutioj away via transport pods to your enemies tho\\nPersona: that will make them real angry and they will send raids to you\\nPersona: there are also sangophuages - pretty much vampires that can live forever but have to drink blood - can be harvested regularly from prisoners\\nPersona: There is also luciferium, a drug I never dares to take. It makea you instantly addicted to it and then if you dont consume it regularly, you will die. However it could overtime heal up otherwise unhealable injury, including permanent ones.\\nPersona: insane\\nFriend: sounds like a good last resort for units that are low\\nFriend: can you not stack it up so you have for that unit for a while_\\nFriend: and are there some ways that unit can be of good value thanks to that unique circumstance?\n\nLike if it will die anyway, good for recon operation maybe or something where death is high chance\n\nor maybe it can pass on knowledge or something\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: You can get a shot in the head and suffer from a permanent brain injury of some type\\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail"

We went to sleep at 12\\nPersona: But it was very fun, we even danced around the christmas tree singing danish songs. That was my first Danish christmas so it was quite a surprise\\nFriend: aw so cute. I don't think I've ever heard about somebody doing that\\nPersona: Hows your today plan looking? You are busy in the evening right?\\nFriend: my guess would be that yes. I'm in cinema and the movie starts now\\nFriend: but it's Avatar so I'll likely be here for a lot of hours\\nPersona: okaaay, so enjoy the movie, I heard good feedback about it\\nPersona: tell me if you liked it after\\nFriend: it was fun! very wholesome. sort of like the intro to Jurassic Park\\nPersona: Would you recomend it?\\nPersona: I watched Gremlins today for first time\\nFriend: if you can stomach the unapologetically clich\u00e9d plot, I think it's nice lightweight entertainment\\nFriend: but let me give you some unsolicited advice: if you're planning to see it, find a place with a big-ass 3d screen, because we went to Empire where they have a standard one, and it didn't really allow for that immersive experience\\nFriend: I had to google. I've never watched it either. my parents never allowed me when they were on TV because my dad was too scared haha\\nFriend: how was that?\\nPersona: Okay, nice unsolitated advice.\\nPersona: So it might be a bit overrated maybe. I heard some people callled it meaningful\\nPersona: I actually didnt know its scary. But its not really scary\\nPersona: I guess scariest was when they put gremlin in the microwave\\nPersona: My aunt said kids were not allowed hahah\\nPersona: many kids*\\nFriend: hm hard to tell. did they elaborate on what they found meaningful?\\nFriend: I can imagine. but think about the long-term benefits - early induction of microwave-related trauma in children must've hurt the microwave industry at least a bit\\nFriend: haha I don't know anymore what was the intended demographic of that movie then\\nPersona: He said not banal, dont remember elaboration\\nPersona: Yeah, maybe they will not have budget for 5 buttons and do onlu 2\\nPersona: very interesting question, cant think of an answer\\nFriend: you know, I think it's safe to expect that whatever was your opinion on the 1st one, you're going to view the 2nd similarly, because the format is more or less maintained\\nFriend: personally both times I approached that as a perceptually rich experience and an ode to the potential of modern technology, but it's not really my place to dispute that meaning found by others\\nPersona: ahh okay, I watched 1st when I was veryyyy young with my friend and his mom. I remember ir being pretty magical, futuristic and my friend moms comment that it was super long\\nPersona: ye ye, but your opinion is nice with that fiction and film experience \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: oooh right, I didn't take that into account. it may be slightly different for you then. you know, I think I was already 11 or something when the 1st one was released so I did register it\\nFriend: thanks \ud83d\ude05 well the more I think about it, the more I can see why for more spiritual or more philosophically Rosseau-leaning people it may be a more profound experience\\nPersona: Its always nice to rewatch movies I watched as super young, see it through adult eyes\\nPersona: Can  you give me a crashcourse on Rosseau philosphy xd?\\nFriend: oh have you had any life-changing rewatch incidents? because honestly I don't really revisit films that often\\nFriend: have you read or watched 'into the wild'?\\nPersona: I once watched film club and shaved my head after xd\\nPersona: I havent but it looks like something I should watch\\nPersona: Maybe I could it even watch it today\\nPersona: actually what about a cozy 2nd day of christmas movie night?\\nPersona: I want to meet with you again before I fall into Susan's trap or die some other death in UK \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: okay, I must say I don't know what I expected to hear, but I surely didn't expect that\\nFriend: I mean it's not really necessary for Rousseau but they are somehow connected in my mind\\nFriend: oh I'm in my mango chutney empire today and tomorrow\\nPersona: fight club is dangerous to watch\\nPersona: hmm maybe I'll watch it today anyways, depends on my mood\\nPersona: and you finish late?\\nFriend: on the other hand, it could've inspired you to do more questionable things, so perhaps it's good it went in that direction\\nFriend: yup, around 10pm\\nPersona: yeaaaaaah, I think so. Did you ever get very affected?\\nPersona: ugh maybe a bit too late, I have work tommorow too \ud83d\ude2a\\nFriend: oh nono, not to that extent. I went to Vienna because of Before Sunrise, and I have a hypothesis that Skins jump-started my teen rebel phase, but that's about it\\nFriend: yeah, that's a bummer \ud83d\ude1e but don't worry, you're about to watch a survival movie. even Susan won't get you now\\nPersona: That actually sounds like bigger and better thing. I guess for me there were more moments where I can see that my decisions were directly influenced by films, but nothing as nice as travelling to another country. But I would like to. I would love to travel to the kind of town in which call me by your name was shot.\\nPersona: although I remembered another moment when I watched too much The Wolf of Wallstreet and tried to give a speech, very similar to the one Jordan gave to his stratonaites, to my Interact club.\\nPersona: Is Skins a tv series or a film?\\nPersona: yee, you convinced me, I am going to watch it and maybe live another year\\nFriend: nooo, yours makes for a better story, and isn't that the best determinant of the quality of the experience? but true, you can't go wrong with a tiny Italian town\\nFriend: what's an Interact club?"

Unless every 5 min or smth it wants to connect to some service\\nPersona: But signing also seems harmless\\nPersona: I will try the other signer\\nFriend: im thinking the same because it would be a different folder so it should just error\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: i'll do my experimentd xd\\nPersona: With both signers it freezes\\nPersona: so either both signers are fucked up or the spoofing fucks it up\\nFriend: sleep tight\nI can't stay up longer\\nPersona: Goognight\\nPersona: Or it might be the apktool too...\\nPersona: messing with it\\nPersona: I can test for that, but ahhh it takes so long\\nPersona: The Walking Dead is soooooo gooood\\nPersona: holy shit\\nPersona: IT really immerses you\\nPersona: happy eater matd\\nPersona: mate*\\nPersona: easter*\\nPersona: I just woke up\\nFriend: o\nits easter?\nhappy easter :D\\nFriend: i woke recently too\n\nstarted working on the sheet I showed you yesterday\\nFriend: apparently you can get in tivoli\nwith negative test\\nFriend: without a mask\\nPersona: wie\\nPersona: wow\\nPersona: finnally deleted the one drive\\nPersona: folder\\nPersona: Even admin powershell coun;dn't do it\\nFriend: xDD\\nFriend: how did you manage\\nPersona: Downloaded old people and mom type people software \"Wise Force Deleter\" with an UI that just deletes anything\\nPersona: and it worked lol\\nPersona: Maybe my HDD issues will stop now\\nPersona: Cause apparently MS OneDrive posseses power that it cannot handle itselft\\nPersona: As OneDrive and Windows is made by MS, they really sort of a integrate OneDrive into Windows. And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive"

While the total supply here is more than total demand, but this is an economy where suppliers dont have infinite stocks individually, thus they can run out of stock. If you spend a lot of time searching, you might end up getting shit prices as all everything was bought while you were looking.\\nPersona: Seems that after 10 time spent searching, diminishing returns kick in a lot\\nFriend: have you had any lessons on the topic\n\nhowd you get there?\\nFriend: imo great topic\n\nwe do it without thinking twice because there isn't a way to say if it's optimal or not what we do\\nPersona: idk why we had no topic like thst\\nPersona: i just wioke up\\nPersona: fuck i fucked up\\nPersona: i slept the whole day\\nFriend: i figured how to make the calculation btw for going down 2 levels\n\nit depends on whats the cost to get back up to the same level and consider it as if it didnt go down\\nFriend: now a bigger problem.

You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement.

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast"

With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills.

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually.

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast"
