She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday"

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday"

If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\""

You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?
