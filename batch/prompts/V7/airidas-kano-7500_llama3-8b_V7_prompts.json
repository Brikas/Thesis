Not sure if my sis will be available but I might be able to help you find a studio\\nPersona: If I can find time to decide on the design and it's not very expensive and its someone I can trust, I would get it.\\nPersona: The hardest part is the design, it feels hard to choose something that will be on my body for the rest of my life, but I knew I wanted some tatoo for a while\\nPersona: If you or your sister knows a studio that you guys trust, I would very appreciate <3\\nFriend: Ok, I'll ask her\\nFriend: She doesn't speak English that well so I'll do most of the talking hah\\nFriend: But if she decides to do that, I'll help you agree on what you want\\nFriend: Btw most of the artists like to make designs by themselves so no worries\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what energy are you adding?\\nPersona: chill or high energy?\\nFriend: both\\nFriend: go what you think is nice for night bike\\nFriend: phonk or chill or w/e\\nPersona: Lil peeep xd\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: okay noce\\nPersona: got the vobe\\nPersona: phonk\\nPersona: is\\nPersona: nice\\nFriend: Omw\\nPersona: dude I went all in\\nPersona: I imploded the platylist xdd\\nFriend: Here\\nFriend: Got backpack if u pick up sometginf\\nPersona: Weird, from all that sugar, I am not even hungry in the morning\\nPersona: Searching for that girlfriend be like\\nFriend: im starving \n\nbut then again I didnt have tht much\\nFriend: wtf is girfriend in your closet\\nFriend: you only have dirt\\nPersona: Xdddddddd\\nPersona: she sprouted\\nPersona: I am growing my own\\nPersona: Yeha actually me too, it was just 15 mins after I got up my stomach lied to me, then I turned super hungry\\nPersona: Xddd\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: sounded funny\\nFriend: dvrst - reason to live\nwas so good last night\\nFriend: I know it from before\n\nidk why but it feels a bit nostalgic\\nPersona: Have you applied for housing benefiits?\\nPersona: I just did and I think I'll get 460dkk/mo\\nFriend: No bro\nYou cant\\nFriend: We got shared kitchens\\nFriend: if its the same one we talk about\\nPersona: Some of the ppl from my dorm applied\\nPersona: and they all got it\\nPersona: On my contract it says \"own kitchen\"\\nFriend: Oo shit yea\\nFriend: Thats why you got the sink and frisge space\\nFriend: Smart move\\nPersona: Ye, wish I applied earlier\\nPersona: If I applied since I moved in thats would be like 6k of money\\nPersona: So do you want to come to Talent garden tmmrow to study/work?\\nFriend: I go to work tomorrow\nGotta go to talent on  a free day\\nFriend: Can say i dont go to tbe office some day\\nFriend: Or soon maybe we stop going\\nPersona: Xdddd\\nPersona: gold\\nFriend: Nice!\\nFriend: Getting fired not half bad when you chillin\\nFriend: It says min 2 per group?\\nPersona: yeah, but I am not participating as a competitor\\nPersona: I am going to shoot a video for it\\nPersona: At first I just thought of spectating it, and I will, but also while shooting video\\nPersona: How did they like the candy?\\nPersona: You could actually participate, you are a dev.

Notion is really nice for project maagement and has a half amazing half decent table (database) functionality. But for personal wiki I prefer Logseq\\nFriend: Markdown is ez pz\n\nThe usefulness comes from the extensions and those are a bit intimidating\\nPersona: ah okay, I didn't try much extensions\\nPersona: I didn't like obsidian because it has stupid functionality for block references. Its more page based.\\nPersona: And it also has much more primitived block embed functinality (make a editable reference to a block). You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. On Logseq this is possible, fully native, and easy.\\nPersona: Thats the feature I was dreaming about in MindManager for so long\\nPersona: I don't like page based, because a big task in note-taking is deciding where to put what and then deciding where to look for what. If you also need to think about pages, then its an extra variable in your decision making process.\\nPersona: Logseq automates that, so any single block can be a page, you just press on it to zoom in and it becomes the root element\\nPersona: But they also have pages (which is sometimes till needed so files don't get too large and if you want to collaborate, so you can work in diff files, like in coding)\\nPersona: The only issue with Logseq is that its less stable and feels a little weirder and less polished than Obsidian. Obsidian is super smooth\\nPersona: Next semester I will try switching uni notes to Logseq, but I am a little anxious. There will be many improvements with that - like I can't wait till I can use block embeds, also I will be able to share my notes with other people in a standardized format. Search functionality is better too.\\nPersona: But I am anxious that the mindmap layout presentation will turn out to be much more superior to bullet list presentation when it comes to complex topics I will study. Also in Logseq there is less options for content visual customization, so making things standout is more limited (bolding, colors still work).\\nPersona: bruuug sweet\\nPersona: you look good\\nFriend: Thanks man\nWas a good time\\nFriend: I'm happy she wants to show me\\nFriend: Was thinking some days before that ppl post on diff social media diff side of them and was wondering if she will just want her own photos on instagram\\nFriend: Or would she show me\\nFriend: Cause ive heard a lot instagram is more for dating kind of\\nFriend: What are block embeds\\nFriend: Yeah.. i want some way to combine mindmanager mindmaps with note app\\nPersona: ig is general purpose social media\\nPersona: i dont think it has much specialization like linkedin which is for professionals\\nPersona: almost everykind of businness has ig profile these days\\nPersona: I think instsgram is good for dating, but its the same as saying 'a car is good for dating'. Ita good but its not made for it specifically\\nPersona: You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. \n\nobj_A = Object()\n\nobj_A.var1 = \"hello\"\nobj_A2 = obj_A\nobj_A2.var1 = \"world\"\nprint(obj_A.var1) // \"world\"\\nPersona: thats prob best way to explain it\\nPersona: its like a mirror reference thats editable\\nPersona: mindmanager is so bad for integrations\\nFriend: They have that?\n\nWhere does the real obj live\nIs one original and other are references\\nFriend: Huh\nYoutube-like?\\nFriend: But with photos\\nPersona: I will show you later\\nPersona: bro do you really have no idea how instragram is used?\\nPersona: Its not like youtube in many ways. Its just very general. Less general than facebook, but fb has just became too general for the new times\\nPersona: you post updates about what you do, about your interests, show off some aesthetic you capture, show off the imagine of yourself you are creating, show your hobbies maybe, show your personality in reel, photos, stories\\nPersona: I mostly use it to see what my friends, aquantainces are up to.

Not sure if my sis will be available but I might be able to help you find a studio\\nPersona: If I can find time to decide on the design and it's not very expensive and its someone I can trust, I would get it.\\nPersona: The hardest part is the design, it feels hard to choose something that will be on my body for the rest of my life, but I knew I wanted some tatoo for a while\\nPersona: If you or your sister knows a studio that you guys trust, I would very appreciate <3\\nFriend: Ok, I'll ask her\\nFriend: She doesn't speak English that well so I'll do most of the talking hah\\nFriend: But if she decides to do that, I'll help you agree on what you want\\nFriend: Btw most of the artists like to make designs by themselves so no worries\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: after work I am like fucking braind ead\\nFriend: I'm telling you day trading in PrUn is the shit\n\nmade 2k in current assets extra\n\nsince last screenshot\n\njust because I put shit up on the low and high price\\nPersona: xxdddd\\nPersona: 2k :o\\nPersona: how much labour hour tho?\\nFriend: 4 times I went online\n\ngo through the offers I've put (like 20 different ticckrs)\n\nsee if someone put up a better offer so i can underbid\\nPersona: Try LST and SIO I had like 25% spread and made 500 earlier today\\nFriend: materials like that don't get sold often at my place\n\nI go into things that can be produced and used locally\nif there is a lot of traffic then often the offer can work\n\nor often someone would underbid xD but your money won't be tied in there for long\\nFriend: I want to make a trip to you again\n\nhave anything you want to transport?\\nPersona: not really\\nPersona: Man I kinda want those thc pancakes xd\\nFriend: now? :D\\nPersona: technically yeah now xd\\nFriend: be there in 20\\nPersona: I am just kinda paranoid lately idk why\\nPersona: what no xdddd\\nPersona: stop joking\\nPersona: Iknow its april fools\\nFriend: i haven't exercised today\n\ngood time to go\\nFriend: the fuck you mean joking\n\nI'm serious about my exercise\\nFriend: give me a min.

Maybe at masters its different\\nPersona: honestly its hard to get over the fact that CBS doesnt approve KEA econ etcs\\nPersona: Ola Puki should do smth about it. He should somehow maybe do a separate exam for econ at KEA\\nPersona: I did econ course three times in my life now, and KEA econ was easier than highschool IB\\nPersona: we got a 10 from micro, but with what I have learned from that I would have prob gotten max a 0\\nPersona: CBS econ was fucking hard\\nPersona: I am.so glad I didnt need to take exam. I felt a bit like cheating.\\nFriend: Cbs pissing me off\n\nThey declined previous applications i had because of english missing\n\nI did ielts and applied.

A yeat ago I even matched all parts and estimated the cost. But I am always reluctant. What I would be happy with is around 7000-8000dkk. Its like equal to one long expensive trip abrouad, or maybe 2 cheaper ones.\\nPersona: But then also by doing that I will ground myself more to nolifer life (lol wtf nice oxymoron), while instead I been trying to go out more.\\nPersona: But then damn, a good pc is like my deepest heart desire and also childhood trauma. Since games good better, I couldnt play any new ones. The last title I could play with maybe 50fps was GTA IV\\nPersona: and that was even laggy\\nPersona: COD MW3 (the old one), Advanced warfare, none ran well. Lowest settings were lagging.\\nPersona: GTA V runs after its been ultra optimized by devs, but low graphics too\\nPersona: Some games like Squad are too laggy to enjoy\\nPersona: Cyberpunk - didnt even dare to try\\nPersona: PCVR prob wont even run\\nPersona: My brother got a decent gaming pc, I remember I was feeling incredible happt seeing high graphics with no lag. It was magical\\nPersona: so yeah\\nPersona: idk, is this happiness worth the risk of falling into nolifer hole\\nPersona: So little of my friends play pc games these days\\nPersona: wtf this is so sad\\nPersona: Life is no longer fun because we have real goals now? wtf\\nPersona: life as a kid was more meaningful\\nPersona: now its a lot of pretending\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: most probably after today's evening you will be able to imagine that <3\\nFriend: 5-6pm at my place?\\nPersona: sounds good, I'll be around 6pm\\nPersona: will do a bit of thesis work\\nPersona: what about snacks and some? we should do some shopping\\nFriend: I bought two packs o chips and drink\\nFriend: You can bring frozen pizzw\\nFriend: Or something proper for eat\\nPersona: pizza is good. But maybe we need more snacks? Whos coming?\\nPersona: Maybe I could stop by a store\\nPersona: maybe I should buy a vape too\\nFriend: Me you Edward Kaja Antoni\\nFriend: What is it?\\nFriend: I thought you are bringing a robot\\nPersona: oh yeah I meant robot\\nPersona: but I have to buy it then\\nPersona: hows apetite when on acid?\\nPersona: Lets take it\\nPersona: I will come at 7, got very inspired with thesis work\\nFriend: Ohhhh\\nFriend: Right\\nPersona: or maybe 18:30\\nFriend: Yup\\nFriend: Can you bring something to drink\\nPersona: sure will\\nPersona: yeaah, we have to wait\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: You called Patryk.\\nFriend: great to hear that man :D\\nFriend: Huge indeed\\nFriend: Xdddd\\nPersona: Yeah i can pick up today\\nFriend: greeeat\\nPersona: I forgot today\\nPersona: but will pick up next time im there this week\\nFriend: No worries\\nPersona: oh fuck I havent\\nPersona: is there a deadline?\\nFriend: Mission failed\\nFriend: We will get them next time\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: I think campus desk closed now\\nPersona: But I will return\\nPersona: the tickets are to danish comedy show place and they dont have anything english arm\\nPersona: atm\\nPersona: so they are pretty useless\\nPersona: but\\nPersona: maybe they will have later\\nPersona: okay nice\\nPersona: I want your show regardless\\nPersona: Thank you for your feedback!\\nPersona: If there is any tech, thats not really useful for its price, but I will get its this\\nPersona: I would get it just for the fact. Bionics and augmenting human physical capabilities is something that amazes me\\nPersona: i played too much Rimworld\\nPersona: yeah, the event is also where I saw it\\nPersona: eeevent*\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: How much do you think android phone price will drop after S24 release on jan 31?\\nPersona: is it worth waiting?\\nFriend: Not much\\nFriend: I think around nothing\\nPersona: really? why would it not?\\nPersona: I found this perfect life simulator\\nFriend: because market already knows the release date\\nFriend: the only thing why the price will be lower is that some tech savys will like to sell their phone and buy new one\\nPersona: thats true\\nPersona: u convinced me\\nFriend: most of the people will sell it for the same price as now but there will be some in rush\\nFriend: or who don't give a fuck\\nFriend: and that's how you can get their phone cheaper\\nFriend: CBS Douche The Game?\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: thats how its called\\nFriend: woow LAM sounds like a crazy good idea\\nPersona: He is right about general user experience of 'an app for everything' being not good enough anymore\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement.

In addition, you will deduct their implicit video game preferences by shadowing chats between the subject and friends. You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good?

Maybe at masters its different\\nPersona: honestly its hard to get over the fact that CBS doesnt approve KEA econ etcs\\nPersona: Ola Puki should do smth about it. He should somehow maybe do a separate exam for econ at KEA\\nPersona: I did econ course three times in my life now, and KEA econ was easier than highschool IB\\nPersona: we got a 10 from micro, but with what I have learned from that I would have prob gotten max a 0\\nPersona: CBS econ was fucking hard\\nPersona: I am.so glad I didnt need to take exam. I felt a bit like cheating.\\nFriend: Cbs pissing me off\n\nThey declined previous applications i had because of english missing\n\nI did ielts and applied. Then econ missing\n\nLast year when i applied figured out the language rules and i didnt have to do english exams. And they said sorry\n\nNow on their website it still says tho KEA students need to fulfil english somehow\\nFriend: I go talk to Ola\\nFriend: He needs to up his game\\nFriend: KEA BEIT has english B and thats enough for the master\\nPersona: yeah, cbs been fucking you over. I guess they have so many applicant that their mistakes dont cost them much\\nPersona: tell me more\\nFriend: Lets go?:D\\nPersona: thats interesting\\nPersona: Ever been to silent disco?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: First time\\nPersona: I am in, should I buy the ticket?\\nFriend: Yeah\nI'll getone today\\nPersona: Yo, you want to join Presidents Summit?\\nFriend: When what maybe\\nPersona: Wednessday\\nPersona: as a volunteer\\nPersona: we still need ~15 volunteers\\nPersona: There are loads of new VR games. Do you want to make a VR night some time after exams?\\nPersona: Do you go to Bulgaria?\\nFriend: vr night :O mine isn't set up\\nFriend: I might have to go for a day or two\n\nOtherwise for vacation i'll go maybe august\\nPersona: We do it later, so you plenty of time to setup\\nPersona: I just downloaded 10+ vr games to my flash drive\\nPersona: but if you dont mind waiting the slow download speeds you can dl yourself\\nPersona: there is a website linked in r/questpiracy\\nPersona: rookie sideloader\\nPersona: just for a day or two? how cheap are the tickets?\\nFriend: eh 800 both ways is normal price\\nFriend: can go higher\nsometimes lower\\nFriend: what are you up to?\nYou wanna join me?\\nFriend: yeah if parents wanna buy an apartment i might need to go sign and help buy it\\nPersona: Oh, you need to sign\\nPersona: I was just asking to know if you are available in June\\nPersona: Me and a couple of other ppl from cbs were thinking to do a trip to Bulgaria actually, I will let you know whats happening and you should join us if we go, but not planning rn, cause so many exams\\nFriend: If hiking, im in!!\\nPersona: hiking? What are the options 4 that?\\nFriend: \u0427\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0435\n\u0421\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0442\u0435 \u0420\u0438\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430\n\u0414\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0430\\nFriend: Movie today?\\nPersona: exam bro, exams\\nPersona: we have 5 exams\\nPersona: 2 done, 3 left\\nPersona: group hand in on thursday\\nFriend: x___x\\nFriend: gl\\nPersona: Man, from time to time I keep thinking to myself that I should build a proper gaming pc. A yeat ago I even matched all parts and estimated the cost. But I am always reluctant. What I would be happy with is around 7000-8000dkk. Its like equal to one long expensive trip abrouad, or maybe 2 cheaper ones.\\nPersona: But then also by doing that I will ground myself more to nolifer life (lol wtf nice oxymoron), while instead I been trying to go out more.\\nPersona: But then damn, a good pc is like my deepest heart desire and also childhood trauma. Since games good better, I couldnt play any new ones. The last title I could play with maybe 50fps was GTA IV\\nPersona: and that was even laggy\\nPersona: COD MW3 (the old one), Advanced warfare, none ran well. Lowest settings were lagging.\\nPersona: GTA V runs after its been ultra optimized by devs, but low graphics too\\nPersona: Some games like Squad are too laggy to enjoy\\nPersona: Cyberpunk - didnt even dare to try\\nPersona: PCVR prob wont even run\\nPersona: My brother got a decent gaming pc, I remember I was feeling incredible happt seeing high graphics with no lag.

Much faster\\nPersona: I would say I really recomend it\\nFriend: Sounds good\\nPersona: I woouln't*\\nPersona: I dont recomend it very mcuh xd or maybe thats my impression after trying the new version\\nPersona: it almost feels the same as the old, but for someone who never played, Insurgency might be intereating\\nPersona: and terryfying\\nPersona: like this game is so scary, you are advancing and someone lays down some suppressive fire on you. It.feels intense\\nFriend: imagine that in vr :o\\nPersona: would be cool\\nPersona: last minute decided to go\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: May\\nPersona: Then maybe invest in non ai companies\\nPersona: if you have the time to find\\nPersona: but you know better\\nFriend: But if ai bubble bursts then overall market will go down as ai is responsible for current bull market\\nPersona: You are probably right\\nFriend: who knows, this bubble can grow for a year or two, or maybe its not a bubble and nVidia is really worth 500USD per share xd\\nPersona: their graphics cards are having very slight improvements in gaming\\nPersona: and big increases in price\\nPersona: seems like their core is not very good\\nFriend: gaming doesn't matter in terms of their value now\\nPersona: why>\\nFriend: its all about AI\\nFriend: their gpu's are best for NLP models\\nPersona: yeah so if it fails, then it will depend on its deep core.

Any tips on getting around Lithuania?\n\nI checked the flights and all of them have a transfer in CPH xd (which is not that bad but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the best way). There are direct flights to Vilnius but then it\u2019s difficult to get to Klaipeda\\nFriend: Do you have anything like bla bla car, flixbus etc?\\nFriend: Any hidden means of transport\\nFriend: I\u2019ll have heavy luggage so that makes flying expensive\\nPersona: probably ryanair flight to Kaunas and then train/bus to Klaipeda\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: klaipeda has no aiport\\nPersona: so you either go to vilnius or kaunas\\nPersona: Kaunas is usually cheaper\\nPersona: The train will cost you more than the flight \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: although it seems that its a deal only for those days\\nPersona: You can fly to Palanga actually\\nPersona: Its a new airport\\nPersona: Palanga is very close to Klaipeda\\nPersona: never been to this airport actually\\nPersona: Palanga is a great coastal town itself\\nPersona: full of tourista during summer\\nPersona: And you can get from palanga to klaipeda with a bus very cheap\\nFriend: Yup, sorry. I meant Palanga as it\u2019s nearby\\nFriend: What\u2019s this app?\\nPersona: Kiwi\\nFriend: I\u2019ve been there \ud83d\ude0a but by car, it was much easier hah\\nFriend: Omg perfect\\nPersona: if you go to vilnius, trains ar\u0119 very expensive generally buy they are fast\\nPersona: Okay so just look at the total price and time it will take you. Vilnius klaipeda will add you + 2-3hrs and ~20-25 eur\\nPersona: So maybe indirect to Palanga is worth it\\nPersona: okay wtf 4hrs, thats because it stops at \u0161iauliai. This is so stupid\\nPersona: This is so stupid. Lithuania has no railway Vilnius - Klaipeda, so they have to go through \u0160iauliai\\nPersona: so dont take train if you go to Vilnius, takr a bus. But that 3-4hrs too\\nPersona: So I think Palanga might be fastest\\nPersona: which is good for me cause I like in \u0160iauliai and can get to both cities in 2h \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: For some reason there are no direct flights except for the date that you chose xd Maybe they\u2019ll add it later. 60z\u0142 flight would be perfect\ud83e\udd79\\nPersona: whats the date?\\nPersona: yeah thats a bit weirs\\nPersona: weird*\\nFriend: June\\nFriend: 25/26th\\nPersona: oh planning very ahead\\nFriend: Yup, I have to make sure that it\u2019s possible before booking anything\\nFriend: I want to sign up for the tall ship races but it requires tons of logistics and money\\nFriend: At least the flight back from Helsinki is easy\\nFriend: Tbh I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll be able to go as it starts on the same day as my finals XD\\nPersona: im a such a happy boi\\nPersona: its like a christmas tree for me\\nFriend: So how many computers is it now?

You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So when yday me and my gf connected to my VPN, we were able to play on LAN\\nFriend: eh? :DD I didn't know it works like that\\nFriend: we can make a LAN cs game but be in different places?\\nPersona: So this opens up a lot of games multiplayer for cracked games, without actually needing to be on LAN.\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: how much is the vpn?\\nPersona: Instead of needing to host a dedicated server\\nFriend: subscription for cracked games xD\\nPersona: Well Im renting out a virtual private server for ~6$ a month.\\nPersona: 1GB ram, 1000GB bandwidth, I installed Linux\\nFriend: oh but for cs you need good latency\\nPersona: I am in netherlands\\nPersona: the latency is fine\\nPersona: Its basicaly then same as if you were playing CS on a netherlands server\\nPersona: I thik\\nPersona: Or maybe not\\nPersona: yeah its not\\nPersona: its double\\nFriend: why not? this made super sense to me :D\\nFriend: oh\\nPersona: So say you are in DK I am in LT\\nFriend: its cs server -> vpn server -> you\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: not cs server -> you so double\\nFriend: i see now xD\\nPersona: But netherlands is pretty close\\nPersona: Btw, you dont need to buy\\nPersona: You can use mine\\nPersona: I barely use it\\nFriend: after 5 more years when i catch a gf\\nPersona: I made you a profile, but to make what I said work, you may need to give a profile to all of the players, so if you need that hmu, I will give you the pass to webui\\nFriend: we can make a real lan party first :D\\nPersona: :DDDD\\nPersona: yeah I been wanting\\nPersona: for a while\\nPersona: KEA gang is probably more upto that any other gang I know\\nFriend: hows it in CBS\\nPersona: Also, this game Mindustry\\nPersona: is good\\nPersona: Its paid on steam, but its free on itch.io\\nFriend: not many gamers :D ?\\nPersona: just itch.io does not offer seamless multiplayer like Steam offers\\nPersona: So that why we used VPN LAN\\nPersona: Not really\\nPersona: i dont even know\\nFriend: lol wut :D you played that one with Agne?\\nPersona: THe guys I know dont seem to be talking about it\\nPersona: I didn't ask explicitly\\nFriend: making her a nerd or she is one?\\nPersona: Yeah, surprising right? xd\\nPersona: dude xddd\\nPersona: you are reading my mind\\nPersona: I kind of actually have a little though\\nPersona: 'I should make her smarter muhahaha\"\\nPersona: by playing those games\\nPersona: We both played the game for the first time, and not gonna lie, I cought on to the game magnituude times faster and better\\nPersona: But she is a minecraft, csgo, roblox gamer so yee\\nFriend: yeah, youre seasoned in the management genre\\nPersona: When we were at my place, we wanted to dedicate one nigh to gaming, and I saw terraria on her dekstop and I was like, oh this is nerdy enough.

Maybe at masters its different\\nPersona: honestly its hard to get over the fact that CBS doesnt approve KEA econ etcs\\nPersona: Ola Puki should do smth about it. He should somehow maybe do a separate exam for econ at KEA\\nPersona: I did econ course three times in my life now, and KEA econ was easier than highschool IB\\nPersona: we got a 10 from micro, but with what I have learned from that I would have prob gotten max a 0\\nPersona: CBS econ was fucking hard\\nPersona: I am.so glad I didnt need to take exam. I felt a bit like cheating.\\nFriend: Cbs pissing me off\n\nThey declined previous applications i had because of english missing\n\nI did ielts and applied.

A yeat ago I even matched all parts and estimated the cost. But I am always reluctant. What I would be happy with is around 7000-8000dkk. Its like equal to one long expensive trip abrouad, or maybe 2 cheaper ones.\\nPersona: But then also by doing that I will ground myself more to nolifer life (lol wtf nice oxymoron), while instead I been trying to go out more.\\nPersona: But then damn, a good pc is like my deepest heart desire and also childhood trauma. Since games good better, I couldnt play any new ones. The last title I could play with maybe 50fps was GTA IV\\nPersona: and that was even laggy\\nPersona: COD MW3 (the old one), Advanced warfare, none ran well. Lowest settings were lagging.\\nPersona: GTA V runs after its been ultra optimized by devs, but low graphics too\\nPersona: Some games like Squad are too laggy to enjoy\\nPersona: Cyberpunk - didnt even dare to try\\nPersona: PCVR prob wont even run\\nPersona: My brother got a decent gaming pc, I remember I was feeling incredible happt seeing high graphics with no lag.

I guess if you find someone with similar taste\\nPersona: cause often I just said smth like 'ok' and no more chqtted if they listened to crap xddd\\nFriend: Im doing a study on sarcasm\\nPersona: tell.me.more\\nFriend: going through a table with examples\\nFriend: to understand the different kinds\\nPersona: ye those are good\\nFriend: Ed is the kind of sarcasm\\nPersona: xddd\\nFriend: I've been trying to learn some from him from uni the last 2 times we met\\nFriend: analyzing his comments :D\\nPersona: ye ed sarcasm is nice\\nPersona: at highsxhool I used to do the same  xdd\\nPersona: well two or three times\\nFriend: two or three times you did sarcasm at highschool?\\nFriend: is that a lot\\nPersona: nooo\\nFriend: :DD\\nPersona: tried to learn some lines from someone\\nPersona: You learn date stuff and picking up unconciously, but just trying doing, but maybe if you do it conciously its faster and gets deeper\\nPersona: Idk tho, I never had success dating anyone in denmark, just hookups and rarely with someone danish. Maybe danes are for danes\\nPersona: so I agree with foreigner choice\\nFriend: oooh fuck\\nFriend: i got a perfect one\\nPersona: send pic\\nPersona: you matched?\\nFriend: she working at Laerdal or whatever its called\\nPersona: I have a good BIO for you\\nFriend: googled the company and got resuls like this\\nFriend: i wanna send a pic:\\nPersona: \"If can't do better than what I saw on VR porn, just swipe left\"\\nPersona: xddd\\nFriend: and cause she is product design\n\n\"if you designed this, I hate you.

You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n\nFriend: NO WAY. so you are the reason why Kong Strong without sugar was out of stock for approximately forever! I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it back a few weeks ago\\nFriend: guess what's the Venn diagram of this and people who've tried wodzionka\\nFriend: but actually it's better that I'd have expected, considering that over 90% is catholic on paper. we're rebels\\nPersona: So we force them to take the wodzionka? How would the ransom note look like?\\nPersona: The infamous shortage was indeed due to my quarterly kong strong procurement round. I suggest you stack up now, cause the my next quarterly round is starting soon.\\nPersona: ok ok, If i too ate wozdzionka I would probably believe in hell, god, 5 second rule,  etc. Clearly explains\\nPersona: Also, would you like to meet this weekend as I am sure our plan to ransom NASA could be discussed in better detail in person? I will make a semi-educated guess there and suggest board games, possibly in a cafe, or maybe a film?\\nFriend: gosh, sorry for that lightning response speed. I've been preoccupied with my studies of wodzionka recipes\\nFriend: no, I've actually been tad busy\\nFriend: oh the idea sounds wonderful, but this is a terrible time. you know, there's a shit ton of work I need to do in the next two weeks, so I'm really tentative with making any definitive plans because I will very likely flake\\nFriend: I haven't quite figured out yet how to make it clear that this is an offer they cannot refuse. do you happen to have some dirt on NASA in your files maybe?\\nFriend: providing you with knowledge on turbo wheelchairs might have been the worst mistake I've ever made then\\nFriend: I almost hate how logical it actually is. because wodzionka was a thing decades ago at the time of food shortages, right? and who believes in heaven, hell and all that? old people\\nPersona: hope its going well with the wodzionka research. vital subject\\nPersona: but I joined your late-response club\\nPersona: Now that I am back to my weekly chilling-at-my-couch-and pretending-I-take-time-to-relax-as-a-normal-person, I can look again into our grand plan\\nPersona: I dont have any particular info to potentially shame NASA, but I think they will be interested in wodzionka powers naturally. Unless of course you know smth yourself, cause its still better to be safe and have smth to press with. Should I write them a proposal?\\nPersona: now with that, watch me sweep Lidl clear of all sugarfree kong strongs, drinks them all in an instant, climb mountain everest, square a circle, solve the halting problem and divide by zero just to be sure\\nPersona: but seriously, I can't last a day at work without consuming that and the drink also makes me feel happy and its cheap\\nPersona: so we are about to make NASA become flat-earth believers?\\nPersona: thats a dissapointment. What are busy with these days?\\nFriend: I can't decide whether I'm more surprised that you are able to fit a couch into your room or that you can chill on it with all that Kong in your system\\nFriend: eh so be it. I suppose if necessary we can always just threaten them with good ol' violence\\nFriend: I don't know, personally I can fall asleep immediately after drinking one but they are cheap indeed\\nFriend: if only we can gain something from it\\nFriend: well, I need to write a thesis\\nPersona: Its a bed that can convert to couch like structure. I would never fit a proper couch, not with my unneccesarily large desk atleast\\nPersona: even with all the kongs I drank, solving halting problem and learning to divide by zero gave me enough existential peace that I can relax anytime\\nPersona: then try the reverse psychology. Drink sleeping pills for energy.\\nPersona: the truth!\\nPersona: do thesis semeter(s) feel more busy than normal?\\nFriend: good for you. you can't run a huge scheme from a small desk\\nFriend: is that why maths people have banned dividing by zero? are they just trying to prevent everybody from having fun?\\nFriend: who said this is the goal. look, with my investment in the coffin I need to get my money's worth\\nFriend: hm I suppose they don't have to, but why play life on the easy mode. with a little bit of procrastination you can easily make them feel very busy very suddenly\\nPersona: yes, cause that would give prople all the answers and therefore stop the infinite existential search for meaning, thus reducing consumption and shrinking the economy\\nPersona: So what do you hold as a proper return on coffeine investment?\\nPersona: Yh, I too seem to choose the hard mode of life. I have a speaking disability, where its hard for me to say 'no'. That really ups the difficulty level\\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again. Or make sure I never lose\ud83d\ude0f\\nFriend: NYE is coming. only one way to find out if this is the answer\\nFriend: hahah what is this hint supposed to mean? are you building a gas chamber?\\nFriend: not yet unless I start charging you for my brilliant advice\\nFriend: so you just manipulate people into letting you win by appealing to their sense of environmental responsibility? you know, it has some potential. maybe you should try to escalate this into professional ground\\nPersona: yeah, a kong steam chamber, so I can consume kong 24/7\\nPersona: can I pay in crazy good pool shots?\\nPersona: Problem is that it only works with nice people that seem care about the enviroment. Other people just externalize the costs and dont care\\nPersona: (and thats totally not why I want to play with you and totally not my strategy)\\nPersona: btw, I swear I sent the pigeon with my message to you a week ago, but it must have got lost or ran out of kong or some other tragedy happened\\nFriend: oh I've already given you the award for the most abrupt ghosting incident 2022 (\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f) I'm not sure what to do now\\nFriend: and you can pay me in crazy good pool shots because that can be easily exchanged to money\\nFriend: I don't know which group you think I belong to and I can't quite decide which possibility I  find more offensive\\nPersona: wait, so I am not getting my shiny award anymore? \ud83d\ude25\\nPersona: Deal! I wonder what is the exchange rate for crazy pool shots and currency?\\nPersona: So you prefer playing the bad cop then?\\nFriend: not only that. now we're forced to have an awkward 201? Oscars wrong winner moment. you're one slap away from making it into a complete disaster\\nFriend: according to my research, in some recent championship it was 50000$ for a 13-10 score, which leaves as with ~3846$ per a crazy good shot.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it back a few weeks ago\\nFriend: guess what's the Venn diagram of this and people who've tried wodzionka\\nFriend: but actually it's better that I'd have expected, considering that over 90% is catholic on paper. we're rebels\\nPersona: So we force them to take the wodzionka? How would the ransom note look like?\\nPersona: The infamous shortage was indeed due to my quarterly kong strong procurement round. I suggest you stack up now, cause the my next quarterly round is starting soon.\\nPersona: ok ok, If i too ate wozdzionka I would probably believe in hell, god, 5 second rule,  etc. Clearly explains\\nPersona: Also, would you like to meet this weekend as I am sure our plan to ransom NASA could be discussed in better detail in person? I will make a semi-educated guess there and suggest board games, possibly in a cafe, or maybe a film?\\nFriend: gosh, sorry for that lightning response speed. I've been preoccupied with my studies of wodzionka recipes\\nFriend: no, I've actually been tad busy\\nFriend: oh the idea sounds wonderful, but this is a terrible time. you know, there's a shit ton of work I need to do in the next two weeks, so I'm really tentative with making any definitive plans because I will very likely flake\\nFriend: I haven't quite figured out yet how to make it clear that this is an offer they cannot refuse. do you happen to have some dirt on NASA in your files maybe?\\nFriend: providing you with knowledge on turbo wheelchairs might have been the worst mistake I've ever made then\\nFriend: I almost hate how logical it actually is. because wodzionka was a thing decades ago at the time of food shortages, right? and who believes in heaven, hell and all that? old people\\nPersona: hope its going well with the wodzionka research. vital subject\\nPersona: but I joined your late-response club\\nPersona: Now that I am back to my weekly chilling-at-my-couch-and pretending-I-take-time-to-relax-as-a-normal-person, I can look again into our grand plan\\nPersona: I dont have any particular info to potentially shame NASA, but I think they will be interested in wodzionka powers naturally. Unless of course you know smth yourself, cause its still better to be safe and have smth to press with. Should I write them a proposal?\\nPersona: now with that, watch me sweep Lidl clear of all sugarfree kong strongs, drinks them all in an instant, climb mountain everest, square a circle, solve the halting problem and divide by zero just to be sure\\nPersona: but seriously, I can't last a day at work without consuming that and the drink also makes me feel happy and its cheap\\nPersona: so we are about to make NASA become flat-earth believers?\\nPersona: thats a dissapointment. What are busy with these days?\\nFriend: I can't decide whether I'm more surprised that you are able to fit a couch into your room or that you can chill on it with all that Kong in your system\\nFriend: eh so be it. I suppose if necessary we can always just threaten them with good ol' violence\\nFriend: I don't know, personally I can fall asleep immediately after drinking one but they are cheap indeed\\nFriend: if only we can gain something from it\\nFriend: well, I need to write a thesis\\nPersona: Its a bed that can convert to couch like structure. I would never fit a proper couch, not with my unneccesarily large desk atleast\\nPersona: even with all the kongs I drank, solving halting problem and learning to divide by zero gave me enough existential peace that I can relax anytime\\nPersona: then try the reverse psychology. Drink sleeping pills for energy.\\nPersona: the truth!\\nPersona: do thesis semeter(s) feel more busy than normal?\\nFriend: good for you. you can't run a huge scheme from a small desk\\nFriend: is that why maths people have banned dividing by zero? are they just trying to prevent everybody from having fun?\\nFriend: who said this is the goal. look, with my investment in the coffin I need to get my money's worth\\nFriend: hm I suppose they don't have to, but why play life on the easy mode. with a little bit of procrastination you can easily make them feel very busy very suddenly\\nPersona: yes, cause that would give prople all the answers and therefore stop the infinite existential search for meaning, thus reducing consumption and shrinking the economy\\nPersona: So what do you hold as a proper return on coffeine investment?\\nPersona: Yh, I too seem to choose the hard mode of life. I have a speaking disability, where its hard for me to say 'no'. That really ups the difficulty level\\nPersona: But I view stuff like a cozy board game night as a small balaning act between the difficult hustle and peace\\nFriend: I feel like we've come full circle only to discover that Fight Club was in fact a story of an underground math club\\nFriend: details are yet to be specified, but plan A  is that while I'm asleep in my new luxurious setting, a financial opportunity will manifest itself to me\\nFriend: plan B is that since I will be exceptionally well-rested, I'll no longer need to seek cognitive enhancement. I'll start saving on Kong and the likes. I should break even sooner or later - rather later\\nFriend: easy fix. just say yesn't. follow me for more tips and tricks\\nFriend: that's an interesting take considering that most board game nights inevitably lead to a borderline fistfight between the participants\\nPersona: I havent read the sequel, but bet after the final explosion, division by zero was legalized. Most of the homework assignments Tyler gave must have been math division problems\\nPersona: Your plan A has some potential. Asleep human mind on kong strong is known to be very lucid and it your dreams you can explore and simulate all of the potential investment instruments\\nPersona: But for plan B, I have to warn you that kong effect subsides as it leaves your bloodstream, thus to retain cognitive enhancement, you have to keep a steady flow of kong\\nPersona: Actually great idea! Did you dream that up in your luxuriuos kong-induced sleep?\\nPersona: Games like monopoly are indeeed infamous friendship busters and fight starters. But I may have access to a cooperative fantasy genre, that worst case will lead to the destruction of the game board only\\nFriend: sort of poetic that the clock on the explosives must've reached 0 to initiate that change\\nFriend: shoot, maybe that's where my mistake has been the whole time. I used to take 'one and done' approach. should've gone straight for IV\\nFriend: likely. it's all coming back now\\nFriend: so it's vandalism that consider to be the halfway point between hustle and peace. very well\\nPersona: damn, imagine if an explosive controller was built so that if catches an error, it would detonate, and it just keeps decreasing a counter by 1 every second, until eventual division by zero error is thrown. Would probably lead to many immature detonations during testing though.\\nPersona: get a humidifier, pour kong into it and you'll have effortless constant stimulation. You never asked why I needed so many kongs, but I am hinting you the answer gradually\\nPersona: okay, so the investment is paying off\\nPersona: The catharsis from destroying a board game that you can't beat may be enough to give a sense of peace. But this method is highly unsustainable, as you would need a new game every time, so I would rather take the loss as a learning and play again.

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: most probably after today's evening you will be able to imagine that <3\\nFriend: 5-6pm at my place?\\nPersona: sounds good, I'll be around 6pm\\nPersona: will do a bit of thesis work\\nPersona: what about snacks and some? we should do some shopping\\nFriend: I bought two packs o chips and drink\\nFriend: You can bring frozen pizzw\\nFriend: Or something proper for eat\\nPersona: pizza is good.

We bough a few monster to accompany the vibe, got high on energy drinks af, got too excited and terraria sucked.\\nPersona: So I lost hope until yesterday :Dd\\nPersona: Its similar to Factorio\\nFriend: damn.. living the dream :D\\nFriend: I tried to get my old gf into games but she sucked even in simple ones\\nFriend: she can play only the match 3 games or whatever they are calle\\nFriend: d\\nFriend: like a real boomer\\nPersona: what a match 3 games :D\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: I see\\nFriend: xD\\nPersona: Okay, I feel you xdd\\nPersona: this is not a gamer\\nFriend: puzzle games\n\nbut not even putting too much thought into them\\nFriend: she is playing games to relax.. can you imagine? anyone having fun playing a game and not turning it competitive :D\\nPersona: yeah, of course you may be doing speedruns in them, then its gaming, but prob if you doing that you would also play other games\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah I kinda like using it instead of google\\nPersona: its faster and skips all the bs like cookie prompts and intro's\\nPersona: But I wish chatGPT was as fast as character ai\\nFriend: ugh.. I guess it doesn't know much about finance\n\nbeen trying to get it to tell me ways to calculate dividends\\nPersona: btw, when you API an AI chatbot to your messenger, let me know, so I can use you as a google\\nFriend: but its telling me \"% of cash and cash equivalents\"\\nFriend: idk if companies pay dividend based on cash equivalents\\nPersona: Its really nice with code though\\nFriend: look what i gave it today\\nFriend: its a production function\n\nyou got 3 inputs and 2 items you can make with them\n\nand the profit for the 2 items\\nFriend: you gotta maximize profit\\nFriend: the real answer was given as this (not a real number)\\nFriend: so when it calculated 4 and 2 it hit it right on the spot almost\n\nso I told it to use irrational numbers\n\nthen it got some other answer but the other answer wasnt correct. Idk if it did the math right\\nFriend: but it wrote the same example solution as the one given in the problem\\nFriend: 5*50 + 40*2 = 290 \nquick mafs :D\\nFriend: sometimes its pretty confused.. but it basically gave the whole solution so you can go through and do it yourself\\nPersona: Can you give it a picture?\\nFriend: no\nI wrote down the stuff\\nPersona: Yeah it does that better\\nPersona: damn its packed, how tf does its neural network brain understand that\\nPersona: its kinda ironic that it cant do math. Literally pluging this string beforr = in python, would give answer\\nPersona: They probably should build some interpreter on top thst searches for math in answer and actually solves it with dry algorithms\\nFriend: i think it does math with something like that\\nFriend: but doesnt seem to be the case always\\nPersona: but wtf its terrible then\\nFriend: because I gave it some matrices to solve for my class and it got them right\\nFriend: so i think this time maybe it didnt activate math functions xD\\nPersona: damn nice\\nPersona: Maybe it was from textbooks used as a common problem for students and it was trained on that\\nFriend: idk.. don't think this problem was something from a textbook\n\nour lecturer is making things on the go\\nFriend: we dont even have a textbook for the subject\\nFriend: he is making one as we go\\nPersona: ah okay\\nPersona: then maybe it can do math a little bit\\nPersona: did this right\\nPersona: but took so looong\\nFriend: are you on computer\\nPersona: yh\\nFriend: call share screen I show you something?

My workers use 0.6 a day for now\\nPersona: My consumption in 1/day as I remember\\nFriend: probably because I employ only 120 of them and not 200\\nPersona: Man, yo will have to go to exchange soon anyways\\nFriend: ok so overall consumption is based on employment\\nPersona: and it is not even pricey if you use minimum fuel\\nPersona: Because you need to build more building\\nFriend: how much does fuel cost?\\nPersona: to increase you output level\\nFriend: ye. The time I went, I went for building materials. All other money I spend on overalls\\nFriend: because I haven't maximized my employment\\nPersona: The problem is that the settler building materials are not even on the market\\nPersona: Good that you baught meterials. I dont have money atm xdd\\nPersona: But honestly, that too much OVE\\nFriend: yeah true\\nPersona: if the price goes up, just resell\\nFriend: price will actually fall\n\nand fall more. I checked the price chart\\nPersona: Yeah thats the trends xdd\\nPersona: So idk why you bought so much\\nFriend: incinerator first. I'll produce carbon. Then I have to see which buildings to make from because there will probably be some bottleneck\nlike producing too little plants for the incinerator to run constantly\\nFriend: when we check what to do next this could be a good thing to look at\n\nif you would be able to run it 24/7 producing\\nPersona: Hm. its interesting because we take a very different appaoch here\\nPersona: you own your supply chain. I outsource it\\nFriend: outsourcing will be great. But it will take some work on my side\n\nI'll need to see what stage others around me are at and coordinate maybe\\nPersona: oh y\u0119ah you can do that. I think others ir your planet are all food\\nFriend: xD probably\\nFriend: cause it's fertile and has water\\nPersona: its full now\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: if they've designed some of the planets around in such a way on purpose, then trading cross galaxy would be inevitable at some point.\\nFriend: Would be cheaper to buy overalls from your side (if only you have the materials to make it)\ninstead of using the overpriced AI market\\nFriend: not AI\\nFriend: but the game one\\nPersona: yeah true. this will also drive currencies\\nPersona: how much did you pay for single OVE?\\nFriend: overalls? i think price went up to 120 almost after I was done purchasing\\nPersona: I'll come in 1 hour :D\\nPersona: we'll play some PrUs and VR\\nPersona: I did the setup\\nFriend: O ok\nIll shower and go to the store asap then\\nPersona: we can go to the store together\\nPersona: My aunt wanted to try this VR too. Should I invite her?\\nPersona: im not sure if she would come tho\\nFriend: If you want\nI'm super lazy for cooking tho\nI'm thinking of what would be the easiest \nMy mom recommended tomato rice\nI'm thinking of spinach rice too\\nFriend: Just tell me a time and I'll meet you at netto/Silvan\nI'll be there earlier checking out the pots they have\\nPersona: ok I'll tell you when I'm leaving\\nFriend: Was just thinking \nYour aunt is pretty cool\nThere was this guy that I had a common friend with but when they split up I had nothing in common with him so I couldn't bother him with my physics questions\\nFriend: That's the dude that has PhD in nanotechnology that I told u about\\nFriend: So would be fun to play vr with her too\\nPersona: Oh I think you made a good aquantaince this weekend, so you prob can bother her with physics questions xdd\\nFriend: If I was normal\nBut I'm bad at socializing and i need a reason to meet up\\nFriend: Biking? Because if you don't I'll go shop solo\\nPersona: yeah biking\\nFriend: MU CX gets you the universe map\nand you can see supply and demand for things\n\nwould've been a good indicator to know where would you benefit from transporting goods \n\nbut I think the markets would be a good enough indicator\\nPersona: ill be here in 3\\nPersona: mins\\nPersona: im here\\nFriend: java -jar uber-apk-signer.jar -a /path/to/apks --out /path/to/apks/out\\nPersona: xddd I fucked up man\\nFriend: What thee fuck\\nFriend: Why so expensive\\nPersona: in NC1 its 90 NCC\\nFriend: Apparently there are people in the big campus\nBut they get in with permission of some sory\\nFriend: T\\nFriend: Trying to figure if we can cheat the system and jow\\nFriend: Cards don't work\nSomeone has to open for you\\nFriend: You write a mail to ask for permission/time\\nFriend: Only way I see is if they don't stick around the door for long and you can smugle people\\nFriend: Or else through the window\\nFriend: But 1sr floor is just teacher riooms\\nFriend: Rope?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast"

Why need these two\\nPersona: you can build wihout them\\nFriend: oh\\nFriend: will make one this week then!\nHave to go back to real life :c\\nPersona: But yo\u0161 would need different design them\\nPersona: its actually very simple, big dark area, falling a specific number if blocks\\nFriend: cat I know scares creeper\\nPersona: then you one hit them with a hand\\nFriend: and villager attracts zombie\nor spawns golems if he hears/sees zombie\\nPersona: yeah, that makea golems spawn, but if you want to make an iron ingot and rosr farm, you will need a differnt design\\nPersona: a very funny one with many doors\\nFriend: with doors? man where you get your designs from?\\nFriend: I looked at a dude making a 99.98% efficient farm (he was counting game ticks and everything)\\nPersona: 10+ years of expeience bro xd\\nFriend: but he had to send them to the nether\\nFriend: show me door design iron farm\\nFriend: first time i hear\\nFriend: is it with gates?\\nFriend: cause i used gates xD doors would be funny af\\nPersona: Atleast that  was back in the day, now maybe there are new ones\\nPersona: cause mc got so updated\\nFriend: wth looks like a scary meat grinder\\nPersona: its a metal grinder xd\\nFriend: now the iron golem is with a trapped zombie mid\nand some villagers on the sides watching it\\nFriend: then the rest is like the farm you showed first\n\ndrag golems down to lava\\nFriend: just watched the vid :D interesting design\\nFriend: actually doors\\nPersona: damn I dind;t know guardian farms exists\\nPersona: iron golem spawner lol\\nPersona: thats not vannila\\nPersona: Its lietrally free\\nFriend: no it's not\\nFriend: but pretty good \ndoesn't require villagers or anything\\nFriend: but it took lots of farming to buy\\nFriend: ty\nthis good\\nFriend: I wanted to play skyblock duo a lot\n\nI don't like skyblock\n\nI was there when it was getting popular\\nFriend: but now it's possible! some servers offer\\nFriend: so we duod\\nFriend: can make any size team i think and play\\nPersona: I think I've seen smth like that in some servers\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: haha you definetely could taech about the case LD\\nPersona: oh btw\\nPersona: Wanted to tell you this\\nPersona: I get weird satisfaction that in 2022 Marketing and PR is taught by a young-ish woman teacher with white/brown colored hair, wearing an alternative style red accented suit. :D\\nPersona: Like I would not have approved if it was taught like my Econ teachr, which is a sraith as nerd\\nPersona: And I wouldn't have approved if it was like my DTDDB teacher, whcih as a balding serious face man with classic Navy tuxedo.\\nFriend: DTDDB?\\nFriend: white colored :D? like pruposefully or old\\nPersona: purposelly\\nPersona: not old haha\\nPersona: smth with digital and management and data driver and business\\nFriend: if she has some good opinions \n\ni think it's worth showing her that GME had an announcement today/yesterday\\nFriend: when wall street journal said gme will do NFTs, price went up 30% (they said its cause of the parnership, which wasn't offiicial)\\nFriend: today there is an official announcement and price doesn't move\\nPersona: lol the teacher is explaining what is shorting xdd\\nPersona: fuck man\\nPersona: she does not know the whole story\\nPersona: yo\\nPersona: give me some answers\\nFriend: Am i too late\\nFriend: damn :D im  too late\\nFriend: she giving some good questions\\nFriend: i guess the 3rd one is related to your readings? types of media\\nPersona: nah not really\\nPersona: there was just one reading so far\\nPersona: about the 3 myths of intener\\nPersona: internet*\\nFriend: if you get free id love to hear about the class :D\\nFriend: i checked her out\nshe has written a bunch of cool stuff\\nPersona: :D\\nPersona: I told het about you\\nPersona: her*\\nPersona: She said she would love to discuss\\nPersona: It worked\\nPersona: I was at fotex\\nFriend: Ooh\\nFriend: is it google assistant or how did you do it?\\nFriend: now to see if i ts any foetex or 1 specific\\nFriend: im a dead man \ud83d\udc7b\n\nmy other roomie tested positive too\\nFriend: my my :o\nccan i get her out for a coffee or something?

And I think capital in abstract terms is the relevant factor here.\\nPersona: Capital would be something that last more than a single generation. For example knowledge is capital.\\nPersona: And capital is actually another way of increasing fitness of species\\nPersona: So the two ways of increasing fitness 1) genetical mutation 2) capital\\nPersona: And homo sapiens has come to the point where fitness is grown faster using capital than genetical mutation\\nPersona: Genetical mutations take a lot of iterations, and when human life span is increasing (fitness), geneetical advancement is getting slower and slower\\nPersona: but capital advancement is super fast at this point\\nPersona: Genetical advancement is almost irrelevant now\\nPersona: Things like desire for sex, binge eating is the leftover residue\\nPersona: Which was effective back in the day, when capital was low\\nPersona: Thus reproduction as the meaning of life is very very sub-optimal since while atm reproduction is still essential, but it has extremely big diminishing returns. Compared to building capital which have been showing exponential effect latelt\\nPersona: Raising 10 kids instead of 2 will barelly have marginal added value these days\\nPersona: But inventing cures for diseases for example will increase our fitness\\nPersona: And the concept of 'life' or 'being alive', or even being made out of carbon may not even a fundamental thing.\\nPersona: The algorhythm of genetical mutations can have easy analogies in computer system now, thanks to the built up capital. Thus growth in fitness can happen even without the carbon based individuals.\\nPersona: This is what happends beyond technological singularity\\nPersona: Even at this point, when the number of carbon based individual decrease, optimization will continue to happen. The, what now is hard to label, but lets call it \"the state\" will continue to grow its chances of survival (fitness). And probably will eventually end up even in a different form than 'electricity based state'.\\nPersona: So its just a travelling impulse in the universe the changes its shape\\nPersona: Evolutionary mechanism is not even a fundamental part of it.\\nPersona: Evolutionary mechanism as a way to increase fitness did not go extint yet, but its now inferior to capital as a way to increase fitness\\nPersona: basically, idk where I am going with this\\nPersona: But we are basically apart of the 'carbon based state', at the point where capital is the superios way of increasing fitness. We could say we are in the transition to maybe 'electricity based state', where machines take over naturally.\\nPersona: dammn bro\\nPersona: wtf\\nPersona: Makes me feel so little\\nPersona: But lets add death\\nPersona: Im the early carbon based era, when genetical.advancement was superior, death could have been important because it allowed for natural selection. It was a filter for fit genomes. The only way to increase fitness was with compound reproduction, thus old generations were basically useless. Not only were they useless, but also anti-productive as in our carbon era, the carbon energy is limited and overpopulation makes is harder for new genomes to grow. Thus death of old genomes was optimal. Death as optimal.\\nPersona: these days however, while we are still carbon based, genetical growth is no longer the superior method. Thus this crosses out the statement about \"old generation are useless\", that held true before. Even if we are 10 gen behind and we live 1000 years, we can still build capital.\n\nLimited carbon energy is still a factor though, but its unknown whether the cost of extra carbon energy consumed by older individuals is more than added capital advancement from old individuals.\n\nBefore there was a typeof aging \"generational aging\", which is that your repoduction becomes more and more useless as more compound generations are born. This resulted in the natural development of 'biological aging', like I sad before as it was optimal.\\nPersona: But right now generational aging is insigfificant, thus the underlying reason of biological aging is gone.\\nPersona: Its possible though that its still.optimal because old brains tend to be less innovative, less explorative and thus contribute less to capital. Or even have negative effect on capital.\\nPersona: We no longer need reproduction for fitness growth, thus we may be able to have fitness growth without death as we can get rid of overpopulation by not reproducing (or reproducing at a rate = increase in carbon energy generation capacity)\\nPersona: But young people may however have higher contributions to capital though, due to neuroplasticity. So death may still be optimal.\\nPersona: lol I should stop\\nPersona: I wrote a whole essay here\\nFriend: Fitness setting (current gene) iskinda like knowledge but different\n\nCapital too\\nPersona: I dont get what you mean\\nPersona: Idk bro, I keep changing my opinions\\nPersona: maybe fitness is no longer survival rn\\nPersona: There might be no generally aplicable abstract truth.We are just pieces of predetermined matter in motion\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude16\\nFriend: i think fitness still survival\\nFriend: but we are able to use something more than evolutionary reaction and randomness to survival\\nPersona: what is evolutionary r\u0119action?\\nFriend: cause\\nFriend: the tool for survival of things\\nFriend: is \"make as many of us as possible\"\\nFriend: and let randomness decide whats good\\nPersona: Yeah thats one iteration\\nPersona: Then the dominant one gets to replicate most\\nFriend: but with societal structures and knowledge it changes a bit\\nFriend: and its more like which society is better kind of\\nFriend: but I feel like we can't afford at this stage to let things run it's course and \"test\"\n\nyou either make it or die\n\nlike with things coming into the far future like inevitable sun death \n\nor maybe meteor hitting earth\\nPersona: Genetica I think became almost irrelevant. Its took billions of years. We just took 4000 years to double peoplea life expectancy\\nPersona: Using capital\\nPersona: I lost you there\\nPersona: Testing with death as an answer is no longer relevant\\nPersona: mutations are slow and take thousands of yearz\\nFriend: as in, now it's less evolution on the human level\n\nit's more on the structure that humans are\\nFriend: like a humans evolution is less about the evolution of it's cells\n\nit's more about the evolution of the environment and system that sets up those cells\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: so humans maybe are more irrelevant in the big picture and a big organism made of humans is forming\\nPersona: Agree\\nPersona: But what is the meaning of one concious indicidual then?\\nFriend: but depending on the perspective you could argue there aren't many organisms of humans\n\nlike currently there are. Countries and what not\nand you have some thriving better\n\nbut interstellar wise its just 1 colony\\nFriend: and if its just 1 organism\n\nand it dies\n\ngame over\\nPersona: yeah maybe its smth bigger\\nPersona: But our progress is a bit isolates though\\nPersona: rn its only on earth pretty much ( well technically our solar system maybe )\\nPersona: we were optimized there in isolation\\nPersona: we are not yet competing with anyone else\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: us* I'm part\\nPersona: okay fuck it, leave the Mulholland drive\\nPersona: Dark\\nPersona: I dont get it, which one is it\\nPersona: Daniel is the director?\\nPersona: You sent an attachment.\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: it's a stand up commedy\\nFriend: stand-up comedy\\nPersona: What about this restourant?\\nFriend: just a vietnamese restaurant near my place\n\nZoe likes spicy and I know a hot soup there\n\nthat's the only reason I go\n\nwould be fun if others join, but there is no plan other than that\\nPersona: I am in with the wednesday thing :D\\nPersona: Oh btw, so I guess no movie today?\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: I guess\nforgot about that\\nPersona: saad\\nPersona: But its the right things\\nPersona: thing*\\nFriend: we can do it online I guess\\nFriend: stream it xD\\nFriend: there is Netflix party but it requires people to have netflix. Let's see if I can find something else\\nPersona: naaaa, you can't just bring everyhing online\\nPersona: Its like partying. Partying makes so much less sense online\\nPersona: just postpone it\\nFriend: can you see the movie without logging in netflix\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: you should be in\\nPersona: I have to download the extension\\nPersona: hold on a bit\\nPersona: I mean, you can use twich with OBS :D\\nPersona: That will work 100% in theory\\nPersona: or not twich, prob a private youtube vid\\nFriend: think youtube detects streaming of content like this\\nFriend: but I can try\\nPersona: oh yeah thats true\\nPersona: wait Ill get the extension\\nFriend: I'll try another movie\\nPersona: Dude\\nPersona: simply\\nPersona: DIscord\\nPersona: Stream with discort or Google Meets\\nFriend: Ready in 24 hours\nIt takes 24 hours to activate your account for live streaming. Once activated, you can go live instantly\\nFriend: youtube won't do for me for now\\nPersona: Nah Youtube - you were right, they will copyright\\nFriend: Sure! We can try discord\nShare of screen\nMuted mic and sounds from PC on\\nFriend: we can try after the class or on a break? See if my connection is good enough for you to see and hear without problems\\nPersona: You can stream on discord wither share screen, or stream ur screen into your webcam (using OBS) and then share your 'webcam'\\nPersona: because when sharing screen, sometimes software limits it to 10 fps (for example in G Hangouts)\\nFriend: I'll just directly stream the netflix tab\n\nbut I think the screen wil be black\\nPersona: OKay sure\\nFriend: they have some code that turns the screen black when pic is taken\\nFriend: I found how to bypass it with javascript but just for photos for now\\nPersona: Why would you need to take pics?\\nFriend: I've tried making a screenshot before and know they have some protections\njust saying it probably is the same for video recordings (or screen sharing)\\nPersona: Ahhh, you're talking about Netflix, not Discord\\nPersona: Dude.... Just pirate the content\\nPersona: I have a VPN, i can get the movie with no risk\\nFriend: I get stuff without vpn and it's fine\n\nlet me see what's top voted\\nFriend: my idea was streaming the netflix tab but download will def be better\\nPersona: I think its illegal either way so...\\nFriend: what is? XD\\nFriend: don't know what you are talking about\\nPersona: Pirating a movie or streaming netflix content to others\\nPersona: Altghough I am not sure of Netflix policies, but it would make sense if they disallow to share screenings with larger audiences\\nPersona: So.... If we are doing illegal shit, why not just go fully with piracy lol\\nFriend: I would never do such a thing\\nFriend: I watch the movie alone. Other saw it while we had a video chat but that wasn't my intention :O\\nFriend: should we go for wolf of wallstreet or Benjamin\\nPersona: idk what are you talking about now xdd\\nPersona: nvm\\nPersona: Is it a complete tie?\\nFriend: 10 10 on both\\nFriend: I haven't voted for the wolf cause I've seen it\\nPersona: I watched wolf of wallstreet like 5 times, so personally Benjamin will prob be more interesting for me (never seen it). Yet I can bet my balls that people will like wolf more than benjamin\\nPersona: Anyways, do you actually want to make the movie night online?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: I think well be going home soon\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Ok, finally going back\\nFriend: Will be home in 15min\\nFriend: Im brain dead xd\\nPersona: What happened?\\nFriend: Im just surrounded by people who are not good to me\\nPersona: :((\\nFriend: But I knew this Christmas will be like this so fuck it\\nFriend: At least I had a cool outfit and got a nice mug for sailing\\nPersona: You always have a cool outfit haha\\nFriend: Love this dress\\nFriend: Give me 10min\\nFriend: Will get ready for minecraft\\nPersona: alright\\nPersona: sounds funny\\nPersona: but you will need to download new minecraft\\nFriend: I have it on pink laptop xd\\nFriend: But lets have some dignity\\nPersona: Dont use the pink laptop\\nFriend: Will download it quickly\\nPersona: it will not work on the pink loptop\\nPersona: You need to get this\\nPersona: (get the standalone version)\\nPersona: lmk when we can go on dc\\nFriend: Ok, in a sec\\nFriend: Downloading everything\\nPersona: lets hop on a call, I will tell you what do download inside CurseForge exactly\\nPersona: because there are two versions of Prominence 2, you need the Forge one\\nFriend: Knock knock\\nPersona: Ya ready?\\nPersona: Merry Christmas \u2764\\nFriend: Merry gaming day ;)\\nFriend: This day is much much better\\nFriend: How are you?\\nPersona: I woke up at 15:30 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Now cooking chicken\\nPersona: How are you?\\nFriend: I\u2019m actually quite happy with the day.

I can have goals in rimworld and live with that\\nPersona: I had a pretty good gamd yesterday. I been trying to play naked brutality with almost harderst difficulty, hardcire combat overhaul mod and perdeath\\nPersona: I got pretty far, mode than usual. Usually, I survive around a year and my colony dies, but always in some different ways\\nPersona: Hey mate, patryk, antoni and I are going to try cs2 today\\nPersona: do you want to join?\\nFriend: Yess\\nFriend: Getting it now\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: a bit slow tho\\nPersona: same\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\\nPersona: they well pranked you there\\nPersona: Are you also going to the queens riterement like everyone else seems to?\\nFriend: hahah wait til you spot one of these bad boys in the wild. it's going to blow your mind\\nFriend: TIL that's it's surprisingly difficult to find a good picture of a truck on the internet\\nFriend: but I'm doing that for the benefit of humanity. am I a hero yet?\\nFriend: noo I was at work all day. don't even know what I've missed. did they go out to wave or what?\\nPersona: you mean a truck \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I saw a truck\\nPersona: I was so surprised of this car because its like a personal daily vehicle of this size\\nPersona: thats whay they have in US\\nPersona: US vs EU top selling car\\nPersona: but what is the benefit?\\nFriend: I know, I know. I'm just teasing you\\nFriend: had no idea, but yup, sounds about American\\nFriend: you can look at this from 2 perspectives: 1) I'm working on a therapy aimed to help people suffering from severe cases of dead social battery; 2) currently I'm protecting people from the grumpiness induced by my own severe case of dead social battery\\nFriend: thank you. that was a perfect field report\\nFriend: I accept it as the official version of historical events and refuse to listen to or read anything else about it\\nFriend: oh wow. that's really a lot of people\\nFriend: aw they're so cute with their little flags\\nPersona: its perfect for americans, think about it - you can fit a family of 5 highly overweight persons and at the same time mount a 50cal in the back in case of property defence situation or just for fun.\\nPersona: I might need to sign up for your clinical trials. Is there a placebo piwko and placebo pitbull for control?\\nPersona: You are welcome. You are saving yourself time\\nPersona: \"I also been there, drank beer and wine, but didnt have nothing in my mouth\"\\nPersona: many Lithuanian tales end by a peasant saying this phrase\\nPersona: And when I was there I felt like a peasant\\nFriend: I've always wondered how come US people live out of their cars when they become homeless, but now it makes much more sense. why do you even need a house at this point\\nFriend: placebo piwko - easy, just alco free. placebo pitbull - I guess I'll have to kidnap some bald dude in sunglasses to act as an impersonator. but how will I trick people into thinking they're lying down \ud83e\udd14\\nFriend: if they didn't have nothing, does it mean that they had something? if they in fact didn't have anything, which orifice did the beer and wine enter through? I have questions\\nPersona: I may have added the double negative myself, but thats how it used to say. I always interpret that they didnt have anything to eat\\nPersona: but it shouldnt work if they are just lying with alco free piwko and a bald dude singing pitbull, right? So it should be fine. Its like the shell of the medicine - placebos still have the shell, but not the substance.\\nPersona: They neee to think ita serious\\nPersona: problem that they may still choke and die from placebos, cause they would need to drink when lying\\nFriend: what I get out of this is that the lack of snacks must've been a significant issue at Lithuanian parties once upon a time. you all are angry about that to this day\\nFriend: soo in a perfect world you would like to test the impact of each factor, because you don't know if all are significant or not\\nFriend: but as you can imagine cost wise and statistically it would really suck so no one does studies this complex\\nFriend: what do you mean they need to think it's serious?! it is very serious\\nFriend: I'm so happy to be quoting this legend\\nPersona: I don't actually know why it says that, I just google the actual quote and its \"Ir a\u0161 ten buvau, al\u0173 mid\u0173 g\u0117riau, per barzd\u0105 varv\u0117jo, burnoj netur\u0117jau... \" It means \"And I have also been there, I have drunk beer and mead,  so much it was dripping through my beard, had nothing in my mouth...\"\\nPersona: It was always a mystery to me, I always for some reason assumed that it was because the storyteller was just a peasant in the story and didn't get to eat, but I don't know if that makes sense, since drinks were probably more expensive. Or not? This is mostly medieval times\\nPersona: So I think we can start testing by real lying on the ground, real pitbull (I assume you only need pitbull music and not the actual pitbull next to you), but alcohol free piwko\\nPersona: I can be your test rat\\nPersona: Cause if they did nothing and you just said abrakadabra, they will not think its serious and placebo will not kick in. So they probably need to lie down, even if they are placebos\\nPersona: maybe drinking through straw could reduce side-effect death rates\\nFriend: how many fancy letters do you have\\nFriend: I can understand a or e with a hook, but u? you're really pushing it\\nPersona: ahaahhah, we have three u\\nPersona: u, \u016b and \u0173\\nFriend: oh come on, you either choose fancy top or fancy bottom. you can't have both!\\nFriend: and to think that Slovak and Czech people are making fun of us for being extra...\\nFriend: you even stole their fancy s\\nFriend: I don't know. poor people somehow always manage to get drunk even if they don't have anything to eat\\nFriend: though I have absolutely no idea how to interpret this saying\\nFriend: hm in that case we would have to do a poor man's crossover study with one subject, i.e. you undergo two sessions one with placebo and one with normal piwko, but you don't know which is which\\nFriend: and we measure the difference\\nFriend: actually in the real world you would have one group just sitting instead of lying\\nFriend: who said that's desired?\\nFriend: just give me a list of people who pissed you off recently\\nFriend: might kill two birds with one stone while we're at it\\nFriend: oh no, I have an idea. what if we assume that the key is not in lying but in lying over ground. in that case placebo should be lying under ground\\nFriend: ah no, it doesn't make sense. in that case both groups would have to be in the coffin which defeats the purpose\\nFriend: well, was worth a try \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\\nPersona: that is a cool way. Cant you also be your own study subject? I will randomize the piwko for you\\nPersona: the its n=2\\nPersona: But why not? I want both fancy, what do you mean?\\nPersona: Our language is oldest european, so they stole from us \ud83e\udd78\\nPersona: that is true\\nPersona: somehow\\nPersona: I remember back in highschool I had the desperate friends, with whom I drank sometimes and they were really seeking for tips how to get drunk cheapest. Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: so we duod\\nFriend: can make any size team i think and play\\nPersona: I think I've seen smth like that in some servers\\nPersona: its nice\\nPersona: skyblock is a challenge\\nPersona: the vanilla one atleast really is\\nPersona: I used to make minecraft maps when I was a kid\\nPersona: I made minigame maps with command blocks and redstone\\nFriend: kinda want to try vanilla skyblock\n\ncause this one has some helping stuff\\nPersona: in terms of survival maps\\nFriend: wow\\nPersona: also its sometime nice to downlaod a minecraft map and them play it together\\nPersona: like a minigame one\\nPersona: Like this\\nPersona: OHH there is one sosooooo fun\\nPersona: This one play with your GF\\nPersona: it will be so fun\\nPersona: lucky block race is also a nice mod/map\\nFriend: this is so fun\\nFriend: 200k melon madness views :D\\nFriend: nice\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: its not my map, but I used to mkae such maps too\\nPersona: a while a go\\nPersona: There was one reallhy cool which we finished, but never released a video on it. It was the most advanced one ai ever made\\nPersona: (for the old mc that it was in 2016)\\nPersona: you fly and shoot each other on bow\\nFriend: I didn't learn what all the code name means but when i see it, I know whatsup\\nPersona: yeah same xxdd\\nPersona: I got to learn a bit tho 265 > 264\\nPersona: BRrip the best\\nPersona: camrip never\\nFriend: I was gonna write bdrip but not sure if it was that\nMaybe brrip\\nFriend: Wtf is a camrip\n\nI once watched the first movie upload on zamunda\nAnd it was just someone holding a camera the entire movie..\\nFriend: 1080 > 720 :D\\nFriend: Whats the X Evo tho\nSeen that before a lot\\nPersona: no clue\\nPersona: maybe the uploader but not sure\\nPersona: If it says YIFI its good, it means uploader, and its always good quality\\nPersona: I had a 1 on 1 culsultation with my CTO about systems development generally, in terms of balancing business and development thinking and setting constraints, choosing the right approach. God damn its so nice, a lot of wisdom to get\\nPersona: I really hated one UI thing in this web app I am using, so I changed it myself for myself :)\\nPersona: Everyday perks of becoming a web developer\\nPersona: before, the slider was so paintful to hit that it gave me brain cancer\\nPersona: so fucking cool I can literally customize any app now.

Everyone's still kinda sober, nothing new on the weatern front.\\nPersona: whats the min, max?\\nPersona: But also I havent drank soplica\\nFriend: I can see why, albeit in my head they're categorized as autumny movies\\nFriend: hm, maybe it's a marathon, not a sprint\\nFriend: I need one number between 1 and 36 (I think?)\\nFriend: yes, now I'm comparing your accuracy with and without, so this is the control condition\\nPersona: hm, somehow for me its Christmas vibe, idk it does not make sense too much\\nPersona: looks like it may be\\nPersona: 27\\nPersona: Merry Christmas! \u2764\\nFriend: haha that's adorable!\\nFriend: gl\u00e6delig jul \ud83c\udf84\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: and how was it in the end?\\nPersona: Surprisingly very sober. We went to sleep at 12\\nPersona: But it was very fun, we even danced around the christmas tree singing danish songs. That was my first Danish christmas so it was quite a surprise\\nFriend: aw so cute. I don't think I've ever heard about somebody doing that\\nPersona: Hows your today plan looking? You are busy in the evening right?\\nFriend: my guess would be that yes. I'm in cinema and the movie starts now\\nFriend: but it's Avatar so I'll likely be here for a lot of hours\\nPersona: okaaay, so enjoy the movie, I heard good feedback about it\\nPersona: tell me if you liked it after\\nFriend: it was fun! very wholesome. sort of like the intro to Jurassic Park\\nPersona: Would you recomend it?\\nPersona: I watched Gremlins today for first time\\nFriend: if you can stomach the unapologetically clich\u00e9d plot, I think it's nice lightweight entertainment\\nFriend: but let me give you some unsolicited advice: if you're planning to see it, find a place with a big-ass 3d screen, because we went to Empire where they have a standard one, and it didn't really allow for that immersive experience\\nFriend: I had to google. I've never watched it either. my parents never allowed me when they were on TV because my dad was too scared haha\\nFriend: how was that?\\nPersona: Okay, nice unsolitated advice.\\nPersona: So it might be a bit overrated maybe. I heard some people callled it meaningful\\nPersona: I actually didnt know its scary. But its not really scary\\nPersona: I guess scariest was when they put gremlin in the microwave\\nPersona: My aunt said kids were not allowed hahah\\nPersona: many kids*\\nFriend: hm hard to tell. did they elaborate on what they found meaningful?\\nFriend: I can imagine. but think about the long-term benefits - early induction of microwave-related trauma in children must've hurt the microwave industry at least a bit\\nFriend: haha I don't know anymore what was the intended demographic of that movie then\\nPersona: He said not banal, dont remember elaboration\\nPersona: Yeah, maybe they will not have budget for 5 buttons and do onlu 2\\nPersona: very interesting question, cant think of an answer\\nFriend: you know, I think it's safe to expect that whatever was your opinion on the 1st one, you're going to view the 2nd similarly, because the format is more or less maintained\\nFriend: personally both times I approached that as a perceptually rich experience and an ode to the potential of modern technology, but it's not really my place to dispute that meaning found by others\\nPersona: ahh okay, I watched 1st when I was veryyyy young with my friend and his mom. I remember ir being pretty magical, futuristic and my friend moms comment that it was super long\\nPersona: ye ye, but your opinion is nice with that fiction and film experience \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: oooh right, I didn't take that into account. it may be slightly different for you then. you know, I think I was already 11 or something when the 1st one was released so I did register it\\nFriend: thanks \ud83d\ude05 well the more I think about it, the more I can see why for more spiritual or more philosophically Rosseau-leaning people it may be a more profound experience\\nPersona: Its always nice to rewatch movies I watched as super young, see it through adult eyes\\nPersona: Can  you give me a crashcourse on Rosseau philosphy xd?\\nFriend: oh have you had any life-changing rewatch incidents? because honestly I don't really revisit films that often\\nFriend: have you read or watched 'into the wild'?\\nPersona: I once watched film club and shaved my head after xd\\nPersona: I havent but it looks like something I should watch\\nPersona: Maybe I could it even watch it today\\nPersona: actually what about a cozy 2nd day of christmas movie night?\\nPersona: I want to meet with you again before I fall into Susan's trap or die some other death in UK \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: okay, I must say I don't know what I expected to hear, but I surely didn't expect that\\nFriend: I mean it's not really necessary for Rousseau but they are somehow connected in my mind\\nFriend: oh I'm in my mango chutney empire today and tomorrow\\nPersona: fight club is dangerous to watch\\nPersona: hmm maybe I'll watch it today anyways, depends on my mood\\nPersona: and you finish late?\\nFriend: on the other hand, it could've inspired you to do more questionable things, so perhaps it's good it went in that direction\\nFriend: yup, around 10pm\\nPersona: yeaaaaaah, I think so. Did you ever get very affected?\\nPersona: ugh maybe a bit too late, I have work tommorow too \ud83d\ude2a\\nFriend: oh nono, not to that extent. I went to Vienna because of Before Sunrise, and I have a hypothesis that Skins jump-started my teen rebel phase, but that's about it\\nFriend: yeah, that's a bummer \ud83d\ude1e but don't worry, you're about to watch a survival movie. even Susan won't get you now\\nPersona: That actually sounds like bigger and better thing. I guess for me there were more moments where I can see that my decisions were directly influenced by films, but nothing as nice as travelling to another country. But I would like to. I would love to travel to the kind of town in which call me by your name was shot.\\nPersona: although I remembered another moment when I watched too much The Wolf of Wallstreet and tried to give a speech, very similar to the one Jordan gave to his stratonaites, to my Interact club.\\nPersona: Is Skins a tv series or a film?\\nPersona: yee, you convinced me, I am going to watch it and maybe live another year\\nFriend: nooo, yours makes for a better story, and isn't that the best determinant of the quality of the experience? but true, you can't go wrong with a tiny Italian town\\nFriend: what's an Interact club?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: two of the dudes are god damb big\\nPersona: one does for vc and soft funding project as worm\\nPersona: and sent me a list of links for funding\\nPersona: And Lars is just Lars\\nPersona: socially akward in a unique socially akward but charismatic way\\nPersona: and smart af\\nFriend: I need to find the best (and cheapest) way to Klaipeda. Any tips on getting around Lithuania?\n\nI checked the flights and all of them have a transfer in CPH xd (which is not that bad but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the best way). There are direct flights to Vilnius but then it\u2019s difficult to get to Klaipeda\\nFriend: Do you have anything like bla bla car, flixbus etc?\\nFriend: Any hidden means of transport\\nFriend: I\u2019ll have heavy luggage so that makes flying expensive\\nPersona: probably ryanair flight to Kaunas and then train/bus to Klaipeda\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: klaipeda has no aiport\\nPersona: so you either go to vilnius or kaunas\\nPersona: Kaunas is usually cheaper\\nPersona: The train will cost you more than the flight \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: although it seems that its a deal only for those days\\nPersona: You can fly to Palanga actually\\nPersona: Its a new airport\\nPersona: Palanga is very close to Klaipeda\\nPersona: never been to this airport actually\\nPersona: Palanga is a great coastal town itself\\nPersona: full of tourista during summer\\nPersona: And you can get from palanga to klaipeda with a bus very cheap\\nFriend: Yup, sorry. I meant Palanga as it\u2019s nearby\\nFriend: What\u2019s this app?\\nPersona: Kiwi\\nFriend: I\u2019ve been there \ud83d\ude0a but by car, it was much easier hah\\nFriend: Omg perfect\\nPersona: if you go to vilnius, trains ar\u0119 very expensive generally buy they are fast\\nPersona: Okay so just look at the total price and time it will take you. Vilnius klaipeda will add you + 2-3hrs and ~20-25 eur\\nPersona: So maybe indirect to Palanga is worth it\\nPersona: okay wtf 4hrs, thats because it stops at \u0161iauliai. This is so stupid\\nPersona: This is so stupid. Lithuania has no railway Vilnius - Klaipeda, so they have to go through \u0160iauliai\\nPersona: so dont take train if you go to Vilnius, takr a bus. But that 3-4hrs too\\nPersona: So I think Palanga might be fastest\\nPersona: which is good for me cause I like in \u0160iauliai and can get to both cities in 2h \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: For some reason there are no direct flights except for the date that you chose xd Maybe they\u2019ll add it later. 60z\u0142 flight would be perfect\ud83e\udd79\\nPersona: whats the date?\\nPersona: yeah thats a bit weirs\\nPersona: weird*\\nFriend: June\\nFriend: 25/26th\\nPersona: oh planning very ahead\\nFriend: Yup, I have to make sure that it\u2019s possible before booking anything\\nFriend: I want to sign up for the tall ship races but it requires tons of logistics and money\\nFriend: At least the flight back from Helsinki is easy\\nFriend: Tbh I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll be able to go as it starts on the same day as my finals XD\\nPersona: im a such a happy boi\\nPersona: its like a christmas tree for me\\nFriend: So how many computers is it now?

Exams, trips etc?\\nPersona: sorry was a bit out of life haha\\nPersona: 7 days to die\\nPersona: yeee\\nPersona: To game during holiday xdd\\nFriend: I\u2019m asking because I\u2019m coming to Copenhagen for a week (at least)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What's your plan for today?\\nPersona: Game until maybe 19:00 then stop and try really hard to resist further play\\nFriend: Why?

Any tips on getting around Lithuania?\n\nI checked the flights and all of them have a transfer in CPH xd (which is not that bad but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the best way). There are direct flights to Vilnius but then it\u2019s difficult to get to Klaipeda\\nFriend: Do you have anything like bla bla car, flixbus etc?\\nFriend: Any hidden means of transport\\nFriend: I\u2019ll have heavy luggage so that makes flying expensive\\nPersona: probably ryanair flight to Kaunas and then train/bus to Klaipeda\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: klaipeda has no aiport\\nPersona: so you either go to vilnius or kaunas\\nPersona: Kaunas is usually cheaper\\nPersona: The train will cost you more than the flight \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: although it seems that its a deal only for those days\\nPersona: You can fly to Palanga actually\\nPersona: Its a new airport\\nPersona: Palanga is very close to Klaipeda\\nPersona: never been to this airport actually\\nPersona: Palanga is a great coastal town itself\\nPersona: full of tourista during summer\\nPersona: And you can get from palanga to klaipeda with a bus very cheap\\nFriend: Yup, sorry.

Vilnius klaipeda will add you + 2-3hrs and ~20-25 eur\\nPersona: So maybe indirect to Palanga is worth it\\nPersona: okay wtf 4hrs, thats because it stops at \u0161iauliai. This is so stupid\\nPersona: This is so stupid. Lithuania has no railway Vilnius - Klaipeda, so they have to go through \u0160iauliai\\nPersona: so dont take train if you go to Vilnius, takr a bus. But that 3-4hrs too\\nPersona: So I think Palanga might be fastest\\nPersona: which is good for me cause I like in \u0160iauliai and can get to both cities in 2h \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: For some reason there are no direct flights except for the date that you chose xd Maybe they\u2019ll add it later. 60z\u0142 flight would be perfect\ud83e\udd79\\nPersona: whats the date?\\nPersona: yeah thats a bit weirs\\nPersona: weird*\\nFriend: June\\nFriend: 25/26th\\nPersona: oh planning very ahead\\nFriend: Yup, I have to make sure that it\u2019s possible before booking anything\\nFriend: I want to sign up for the tall ship races but it requires tons of logistics and money\\nFriend: At least the flight back from Helsinki is easy\\nFriend: Tbh I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll be able to go as it starts on the same day as my finals XD\\nPersona: im a such a happy boi\\nPersona: its like a christmas tree for me\\nFriend: So how many computers is it now?

We went to sleep at 12\\nPersona: But it was very fun, we even danced around the christmas tree singing danish songs. That was my first Danish christmas so it was quite a surprise\\nFriend: aw so cute. I don't think I've ever heard about somebody doing that\\nPersona: Hows your today plan looking? You are busy in the evening right?\\nFriend: my guess would be that yes. I'm in cinema and the movie starts now\\nFriend: but it's Avatar so I'll likely be here for a lot of hours\\nPersona: okaaay, so enjoy the movie, I heard good feedback about it\\nPersona: tell me if you liked it after\\nFriend: it was fun! very wholesome. sort of like the intro to Jurassic Park\\nPersona: Would you recomend it?\\nPersona: I watched Gremlins today for first time\\nFriend: if you can stomach the unapologetically clich\u00e9d plot, I think it's nice lightweight entertainment\\nFriend: but let me give you some unsolicited advice: if you're planning to see it, find a place with a big-ass 3d screen, because we went to Empire where they have a standard one, and it didn't really allow for that immersive experience\\nFriend: I had to google. I've never watched it either. my parents never allowed me when they were on TV because my dad was too scared haha\\nFriend: how was that?\\nPersona: Okay, nice unsolitated advice.\\nPersona: So it might be a bit overrated maybe. I heard some people callled it meaningful\\nPersona: I actually didnt know its scary. But its not really scary\\nPersona: I guess scariest was when they put gremlin in the microwave\\nPersona: My aunt said kids were not allowed hahah\\nPersona: many kids*\\nFriend: hm hard to tell. did they elaborate on what they found meaningful?\\nFriend: I can imagine. but think about the long-term benefits - early induction of microwave-related trauma in children must've hurt the microwave industry at least a bit\\nFriend: haha I don't know anymore what was the intended demographic of that movie then\\nPersona: He said not banal, dont remember elaboration\\nPersona: Yeah, maybe they will not have budget for 5 buttons and do onlu 2\\nPersona: very interesting question, cant think of an answer\\nFriend: you know, I think it's safe to expect that whatever was your opinion on the 1st one, you're going to view the 2nd similarly, because the format is more or less maintained\\nFriend: personally both times I approached that as a perceptually rich experience and an ode to the potential of modern technology, but it's not really my place to dispute that meaning found by others\\nPersona: ahh okay, I watched 1st when I was veryyyy young with my friend and his mom. I remember ir being pretty magical, futuristic and my friend moms comment that it was super long\\nPersona: ye ye, but your opinion is nice with that fiction and film experience \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: oooh right, I didn't take that into account. it may be slightly different for you then. you know, I think I was already 11 or something when the 1st one was released so I did register it\\nFriend: thanks \ud83d\ude05 well the more I think about it, the more I can see why for more spiritual or more philosophically Rosseau-leaning people it may be a more profound experience\\nPersona: Its always nice to rewatch movies I watched as super young, see it through adult eyes\\nPersona: Can  you give me a crashcourse on Rosseau philosphy xd?\\nFriend: oh have you had any life-changing rewatch incidents? because honestly I don't really revisit films that often\\nFriend: have you read or watched 'into the wild'?\\nPersona: I once watched film club and shaved my head after xd\\nPersona: I havent but it looks like something I should watch\\nPersona: Maybe I could it even watch it today\\nPersona: actually what about a cozy 2nd day of christmas movie night?\\nPersona: I want to meet with you again before I fall into Susan's trap or die some other death in UK \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: okay, I must say I don't know what I expected to hear, but I surely didn't expect that\\nFriend: I mean it's not really necessary for Rousseau but they are somehow connected in my mind\\nFriend: oh I'm in my mango chutney empire today and tomorrow\\nPersona: fight club is dangerous to watch\\nPersona: hmm maybe I'll watch it today anyways, depends on my mood\\nPersona: and you finish late?\\nFriend: on the other hand, it could've inspired you to do more questionable things, so perhaps it's good it went in that direction\\nFriend: yup, around 10pm\\nPersona: yeaaaaaah, I think so. Did you ever get very affected?\\nPersona: ugh maybe a bit too late, I have work tommorow too \ud83d\ude2a\\nFriend: oh nono, not to that extent. I went to Vienna because of Before Sunrise, and I have a hypothesis that Skins jump-started my teen rebel phase, but that's about it\\nFriend: yeah, that's a bummer \ud83d\ude1e but don't worry, you're about to watch a survival movie. even Susan won't get you now\\nPersona: That actually sounds like bigger and better thing. I guess for me there were more moments where I can see that my decisions were directly influenced by films, but nothing as nice as travelling to another country. But I would like to. I would love to travel to the kind of town in which call me by your name was shot.\\nPersona: although I remembered another moment when I watched too much The Wolf of Wallstreet and tried to give a speech, very similar to the one Jordan gave to his stratonaites, to my Interact club.\\nPersona: Is Skins a tv series or a film?\\nPersona: yee, you convinced me, I am going to watch it and maybe live another year\\nFriend: nooo, yours makes for a better story, and isn't that the best determinant of the quality of the experience?

A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented.

While the total supply here is more than total demand, but this is an economy where suppliers dont have infinite stocks individually, thus they can run out of stock. If you spend a lot of time searching, you might end up getting shit prices as all everything was bought while you were looking.\\nPersona: Seems that after 10 time spent searching, diminishing returns kick in a lot\\nFriend: have you had any lessons on the topic\n\nhowd you get there?\\nFriend: imo great topic\n\nwe do it without thinking twice because there isn't a way to say if it's optimal or not what we do\\nPersona: idk why we had no topic like thst\\nPersona: i just wioke up\\nPersona: fuck i fucked up\\nPersona: i slept the whole day\\nFriend: i figured how to make the calculation btw for going down 2 levels\n\nit depends on whats the cost to get back up to the same level and consider it as if it didnt go down\\nFriend: now a bigger problem.

All good?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: i never seen it\\nPersona: I was very afraid as a kid too\\nPersona: But not anymore now, I dont think anything changed, I just stopped. The best possible explanation is that I decided that if I ever die, plane crash would be the coolest way.\\nPersona: jesus, thats such a terrible thing to say\\nPersona: I think its just impossible. your mind will start procrastinating\\nPersona: come on, fix it! I am honestly very thrilled now xd\\nFriend: aw :c poor friend\\nFriend: haha 'if I ever die'??? is this optional\\nFriend: but plane crash the coolest? why?\\nFriend: it's scary\\nFriend: and possibly one of your family members would have to go and identify your burnt body if there are some remains. that's not great\\nFriend: oh yeah, that's the issue. I just don't have a clear boundary between working and relaxing\\nFriend: oh no, that's not the hospital I currently talk to. that was the one I did my Master's at\\nFriend: the current one only does sth with cbd so more of a Facebook mum vibe rather than tripping vibe\\nPersona: noooo, I did not mean that ahahaha\\nPersona: you are indeed a master of dodging \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah poor Jakub... But I know  he has good company\\nPersona: it just feeels sad to say \"when I die..\"\\nPersona: so I live a little optimism \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: leave*\\nPersona: cant explain, every way I think of explaining would make me sound like a psycho \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: its like there would be atleast so much action to witness, also some chance to survive, depending on type of crash\\nPersona: like sinking is a long slow death,  unspectacular when compared\\nPersona: gosh lets stop this topic xd\\nPersona: so yeah thats why u need the clear relax part\\nPersona: are you working now?\\nFriend: hahaha okay, I admit I didn't read what you were responding to\\nFriend: wowo, I'm so good at this game\\nFriend: what do you want me to fix then? the scale? my understanding of the scale?\\nFriend: isn't that the one that was supposed to move out?\\nFriend: what?! this is like the opposite of psycho death\\nFriend: I have a lot questions, but I'm going to be nice and respect your wish\\nFriend: semi. I'm at the library learning Matlab\\nPersona: omgg xddddd im laughing\\nPersona: i actually dont know what, you said the word fix first \ud83e\udd20\\nPersona: nah, that was patryk\\nPersona: really? is it one of my those misunderstandings of disordee meanings?\\nPersona: although I was trying to say it in the nicest way\\nPersona: by action to witness, I imagined like cabin pressure loss, hull breaking in two mid air, explosions, flying out of the plane\\nPersona: oh well, too late\\nPersona: I have expanded more unfortunatelly\\nPersona: whaaaat? fo real? I am in my cozy bed, listening to macmiller\\nPersona: why matlab tho?\\nFriend: eh mistakes were made. okay, change of the strategy. forget the scale. how does your schedule look like in general\\nFriend: what. how many Polish friends do you have haha. you have more Polish friends than I do\\nFriend: oh no, I was referring to psycho in a common vernacular sense here. I wasn't even considering the psychiatric sense\\nFriend: I wonder whether you'd even feel anything if you fell out. I remember the story of that lady who got sucked out of the window and I think she died almost immediately\\nPersona: a very generalized version look like this\\nFriend: I'm still basically unfurnished so not home much these days\\nFriend: I need it for my potential job and in general it's useful in neuro\\nPersona: possibly. They just keep spawning around me\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude33\\nPersona: there was also a story of a pilot who got sucked out, but somebody held him and he stayed outside of the cabin for a long time and stayed alive.\\nPersona: but yeah, chances could be instant death too\\nPersona: ohhh\\nPersona: why unfurnished?\\nPersona: get furniture!\\nFriend: this is going great haha\\nFriend: also I'm curious what you had to type into Google\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: what is this sorcery. what's your secret\\nFriend: what\\nPersona: ugh I am having a good laugh thanks\\nPersona: it was so genius, I typed \"vertical pattern\"\\nPersona: but come on come on, finish fixing what you started\\nPersona: I think we culturaly match, or we match in humour. Or maybe its because I have soplica\\nPersona: which of the two meanings is more like the \"American Psycho\"?\\nFriend: now I don't want to! I've just come to a conclusion that I'm clearly better at dodgeball than at fixing things. change of career path is canceled\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2e inserting Jaros\u0142aw after talking about plane crashes? how dare you\\nFriend: the latter, strangely enough\\nPersona: you were close, I admit it was my mistake this time. Dont give up, resist urge to dodge, sometimes in dodgeball its better to catch it\\nPersona: generally schedule is flexible\\nPersona: doesnt that make Jaroslaws greeting even better here? \ud83c\udf39\u2615\ufe0f\u2615\ufe0f\\nFriend: oh no, now we're having a Schrodinger's schedule\\nFriend: alright\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \u00f8=oe. \u00e6=ae. \u00e5=a\\nFriend: \u00e5 = aa\\nFriend: petyopz@gmail.com\\nFriend: erkarantaenealleredeforbi\\nPersona: Er nedlukningen overst\u00e5et\\nPersona: er karant\u00e6ne overst\u00e5et?\\nFriend: npm install -g firebase-tools\\nFriend: firebase login\\nFriend: firebase init\\nPersona: er lockdown ovre\\nFriend: firebase serve\\nFriend: firebase deploy\\nPersona: erlockdownovre.dk\\nFriend: tld\\nFriend: top level domain?\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: email: airidas.brikas@gmail.com\npass: toocoldtogethit1\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: Nibba\\nPersona: works\\nFriend: oo its live\\nPersona: but\\nFriend: why you keep saying nigga with b's :D\\nPersona: www does not work\\nPersona: :OOOOOOO\\nPersona: who gave u n word pass?\\nFriend: i identify as black on the inside\\nPersona: I just like to be mad\\nPersona: And find smth wrong\\nPersona: And www is wrong\\nFriend: :DD\\nPersona: atleast we have pending\\nFriend: did you have to do anything to get the non www to work?\\nPersona: But www needs setup\\nPersona: No. just waited\\nFriend: maybe you are right to add the www.

In addition, you will deduct their implicit video game preferences by shadowing chats between the subject and friends. You will be asked to fully immerse yourself in the role, and answer questions from the point of view of the persona. \n#Context \n##Chat conversations between the subject and their friends:\n\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it.

With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: what is rhis?\\nFriend: Controllers\n2 ppl\nDungeons\nSlash kitties\\nFriend: Upgrade skills\\nFriend: Its not that hard tho\\nFriend: Simple control\\nFriend: Idk if i vcan run it\\nPersona: 2 step verification should be from mobile, no?\\nFriend: Ormail\nI try notto enter phone when i can\\nPersona: cat quest sounds good as well. Rimworld is definetely superior option, but if it doesnt work xT game could be nice\\nPersona: Cat* (not xT)\\nPersona: But not at my place, I left a big mess before travel and I am too lazy to move anything\\nPersona: I can come to you, just baught snacks\\nPersona: We can also watch the film \"Downfall\"\\nPersona: I want to watch after auschwitz\\nFriend: A little mess here too but livable if you want\\nFriend: In foetex atm\\nFriend: Home\\nFriend: Shower and stuff\nReaddy if you qant to come in 30+\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: need to get over my laziness\\nFriend: Take your time\nI have postknight 2 on phone xD\nGood game\\nPersona: Yo man, I realized I am.not just lazy I havent slept much\\nPersona: maybe lets do it tommorow\\nPersona: I will.nap\\nFriend: Ah alright\\nFriend: Take care\\nFriend: I'll catch you tomorrow maybe then\\nPersona: bruh real life is intruding into my nolife at this point\\nPersona: this polish chich I dated/slept at in Poland now wants to play pc games with me\\nFriend: Big win\\nPersona: idk man, i wonder how will she enjoy rimworld\\nFriend: Good test\\nFriend: Maybe she does\\nPersona: do you know about banano?\\nPersona: Spent half say trying to fix corrupted windows only to give up and do a reinnstall\\nPersona: I also backuped whole appdata folder just because\\nPersona: it took a while even with robocopy. Maybe that will avoid me making some settings in apps\\nPersona: I am.more and more convincing myself to build a powerful gaming pc. But thats equivalent to 1.5 - 2 trips abroad\\nFriend: NOT A SHITCOIN (UNTIL DIGESTED)\n\nI like it already\\nPersona: xddd\\nFriend: Saw this on my phone and thought you got scared of spilling water\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: No no, I managed to get my windows broken\\nPersona: software issue only\\nPersona: (I think)\\nPersona: But who knows, maybe SSD is bad, although would be super weird given its youth. Or CPU is so old its firing wrong bits\\nFriend: Did app data and files recovered gotyou back browser passwords\\nPersona: I use Bitwarden, so they are encrypted on the cloud\\nPersona: Its mainly for app settings, various game savefiles, vs code extensions, settings\\nFriend: Awh ok :(\\nPersona: But why u ask?\\nPersona: U use chrome passwords?\\nFriend: And mozilla\\nFriend: But thats local i think\\nFriend: Not sure i have acc\\nFriend: Also have some passwords on a mindmap\\nPersona: I was always sceptical about those default solutions\\nPersona: 1password is good, but its paid.

Idk if it did the math right\\nFriend: but it wrote the same example solution as the one given in the problem\\nFriend: 5*50 + 40*2 = 290 \nquick mafs :D\\nFriend: sometimes its pretty confused.. but it basically gave the whole solution so you can go through and do it yourself\\nPersona: Can you give it a picture?\\nFriend: no\nI wrote down the stuff\\nPersona: Yeah it does that better\\nPersona: damn its packed, how tf does its neural network brain understand that\\nPersona: its kinda ironic that it cant do math.

Or maybe tmmrow\\nPersona: Both good for me\\nPersona: I want to do one thing xdd Its going to sound quite weird\\nPersona: But I want to play one singleplayer game together\\nPersona: By just starting to play it at the same time\\nPersona: And the game may surprise you idk :DDD\\nPersona: maybe not\\nFriend: I woudl be surprised if itd not Rimworld\\nPersona: its not rimworld\\nPersona: you would never guess it\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Do u have bags ?\\nFriend: Cuz they dont give bags\\nPersona: what kind of?\\nPersona: I have\\nPersona: some\\nFriend: No mater, just take 1-2\\nPersona: lets go\\nFriend: Yea, damn, need to find coins\\nPersona: do you have?\\nPersona: You called Denis.\\nPersona: im in car\\nFriend: Come\\nFriend: Its almost done :D\\nFriend: Hey, do u want to play some exploding kitties ? \ud83d\ude3a\\nFriend: Dana took little bottle of wine and said lets repeat yesterdays evening, she liked it :)\\nPersona: Hey, you mean today?\\nFriend: Yeah\\nPersona: I have an exam on friday and a busy week ahead \ud83d\ude15\\nPersona: What about weekend?\\nPersona: Btw, I really enjoyed it too\\nFriend: Oh, we thought that u will prepare Wednesday and Thursday :D misunderstood \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: I will, but I need today and tmmrow also \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Sure :)\\nPersona: yo, you home?

I guess they have so many applicant that their mistakes dont cost them much\\nPersona: tell me more\\nFriend: Lets go?:D\\nPersona: thats interesting\\nPersona: Ever been to silent disco?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: First time\\nPersona: I am in, should I buy the ticket?\\nFriend: Yeah\nI'll getone today\\nPersona: Yo, you want to join Presidents Summit?\\nFriend: When what maybe\\nPersona: Wednessday\\nPersona: as a volunteer\\nPersona: we still need ~15 volunteers\\nPersona: There are loads of new VR games. Do you want to make a VR night some time after exams?\\nPersona: Do you go to Bulgaria?\\nFriend: vr night :O mine isn't set up\\nFriend: I might have to go for a day or two\n\nOtherwise for vacation i'll go maybe august\\nPersona: We do it later, so you plenty of time to setup\\nPersona: I just downloaded 10+ vr games to my flash drive\\nPersona: but if you dont mind waiting the slow download speeds you can dl yourself\\nPersona: there is a website linked in r/questpiracy\\nPersona: rookie sideloader\\nPersona: just for a day or two? how cheap are the tickets?\\nFriend: eh 800 both ways is normal price\\nFriend: can go higher\nsometimes lower\\nFriend: what are you up to?\nYou wanna join me?\\nFriend: yeah if parents wanna buy an apartment i might need to go sign and help buy it\\nPersona: Oh, you need to sign\\nPersona: I was just asking to know if you are available in June\\nPersona: Me and a couple of other ppl from cbs were thinking to do a trip to Bulgaria actually, I will let you know whats happening and you should join us if we go, but not planning rn, cause so many exams\\nFriend: If hiking, im in!!\\nPersona: hiking? What are the options 4 that?\\nFriend: \u0427\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0435\n\u0421\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0442\u0435 \u0420\u0438\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430\n\u0414\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0430\\nFriend: Movie today?\\nPersona: exam bro, exams\\nPersona: we have 5 exams\\nPersona: 2 done, 3 left\\nPersona: group hand in on thursday\\nFriend: x___x\\nFriend: gl\\nPersona: Man, from time to time I keep thinking to myself that I should build a proper gaming pc. A yeat ago I even matched all parts and estimated the cost. But I am always reluctant. What I would be happy with is around 7000-8000dkk. Its like equal to one long expensive trip abrouad, or maybe 2 cheaper ones.\\nPersona: But then also by doing that I will ground myself more to nolifer life (lol wtf nice oxymoron), while instead I been trying to go out more.\\nPersona: But then damn, a good pc is like my deepest heart desire and also childhood trauma. Since games good better, I couldnt play any new ones. The last title I could play with maybe 50fps was GTA IV\\nPersona: and that was even laggy\\nPersona: COD MW3 (the old one), Advanced warfare, none ran well. Lowest settings were lagging.\\nPersona: GTA V runs after its been ultra optimized by devs, but low graphics too\\nPersona: Some games like Squad are too laggy to enjoy\\nPersona: Cyberpunk - didnt even dare to try\\nPersona: PCVR prob wont even run\\nPersona: My brother got a decent gaming pc, I remember I was feeling incredible happt seeing high graphics with no lag. It was magical\\nPersona: so yeah\\nPersona: idk, is this happiness worth the risk of falling into nolifer hole\\nPersona: So little of my friends play pc games these days\\nPersona: wtf this is so sad\\nPersona: Life is no longer fun because we have real goals now? wtf\\nPersona: life as a kid was more meaningful\\nPersona: now its a lot of pretending\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: u in bulgaria\\nFriend: we can find a way with technology :D\\nPersona: we can watch it in VR\\nFriend: i don;t know how\nand internet here wouldn't be reliable to get us to watch together like that i think\\nFriend: i was thinking of downloading and playing same time\\nPersona: We can do that on VR\\nPersona: and it will also by synced\\nPersona: and we will see each other\\nPersona: its also free\\nFriend: what program should i get\\nFriend: can we test on a small vid/movie\\nFriend: We will figure something out :D\\nPersona: I think its Big Screens\\nPersona: or smth\\nPersona: its free\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: so where we watch? VR\\nPersona: ?\\nPersona: also maybe it makes more sense to watch this non VR as its a technical film\\nFriend: so we can search things_\\nFriend: ?\\nFriend: we can try vr for something else then\n\nwould be fun to try big screen\\nPersona: VR films are OP\\nPersona: apart from that you cant snack properly\\nPersona: its like having a 200 inch TV at home\\nPersona: thats my dinner\\nFriend: fuck xD dude\nit's not case assignment time\\nFriend: get some nutritious shit\\nFriend: just to have it in case\\nPersona: yeah I had 2 homemade burgers today\\nPersona: porridge\\nPersona: and grohe food at the office\\nPersona: it was supposed to be for the movie that we are not going to watch tonight\\nFriend: its alf\\nPersona: lol wtf is that\\nPersona: I nailed the definition matrix\\nPersona: Found a pattern\\nPersona: Ok wait\\nPersona: I am wrong\\nPersona: this is the proper pattern\\nPersona: Am I crazy - yes\\nFriend: what the fuuuck\\nPersona: do you like it?\\nFriend: ye\nit's crazy\\nFriend: sadly excel doesn't support a hexagonal structure xD\\nFriend: or maybe good it doesn't... you would make some crazy shit\\nPersona: did you try the game? xddd\\nPersona: you can define everything how you want\\nFriend: i was working on a formula last night\n\nso we can input the game state in excel\n\nand then it would come up with the answer immediately\\nPersona: you can even habe different depths\\nFriend: didn't try\\nPersona: Excel suports  pixels. Pixels support everyting\\nPersona: but thats too much\\nFriend: xD pixels?!\n\nare you gona make it zoomed out for hexagonal\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: make like 1 tile be 10x10\\nPersona: cells, that are small and act like pixels\\nFriend: xDD\\nFriend: ok\\nPersona: but I will not do it xddd\\nPersona: yday eas enough\\nPersona: inteterestingly yho\\nPersona: That 0 - 4 H yesterday\\nPersona: felt like 40 mins\\nPersona: Can you solve this?\\nPersona: Its solvable\\nFriend: is a move like D1 legal\\nPersona: no xd\\nPersona: Well in this case you dont need it\\nPersona: but you can define your moves\\nFriend: i cheated\\nFriend: xD\\nFriend: e4 and b5\\nPersona: xdd\\nFriend: thats the best i can do\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: So when yday me and my gf connected to my VPN, we were able to play on LAN\\nFriend: eh? :DD I didn't know it works like that\\nFriend: we can make a LAN cs game but be in different places?\\nPersona: So this opens up a lot of games multiplayer for cracked games, without actually needing to be on LAN.\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: how much is the vpn?\\nPersona: Instead of needing to host a dedicated server\\nFriend: subscription for cracked games xD\\nPersona: Well Im renting out a virtual private server for ~6$ a month.\\nPersona: 1GB ram, 1000GB bandwidth, I installed Linux\\nFriend: oh but for cs you need good latency\\nPersona: I am in netherlands\\nPersona: the latency is fine\\nPersona: Its basicaly then same as if you were playing CS on a netherlands server\\nPersona: I thik\\nPersona: Or maybe not\\nPersona: yeah its not\\nPersona: its double\\nFriend: why not? this made super sense to me :D\\nFriend: oh\\nPersona: So say you are in DK I am in LT\\nFriend: its cs server -> vpn server -> you\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: not cs server -> you so double\\nFriend: i see now xD\\nPersona: But netherlands is pretty close\\nPersona: Btw, you dont need to buy\\nPersona: You can use mine\\nPersona: I barely use it\\nFriend: after 5 more years when i catch a gf\\nPersona: I made you a profile, but to make what I said work, you may need to give a profile to all of the players, so if you need that hmu, I will give you the pass to webui\\nFriend: we can make a real lan party first :D\\nPersona: :DDDD\\nPersona: yeah I been wanting\\nPersona: for a while\\nPersona: KEA gang is probably more upto that any other gang I know\\nFriend: hows it in CBS\\nPersona: Also, this game Mindustry\\nPersona: is good\\nPersona: Its paid on steam, but its free on itch.io\\nFriend: not many gamers :D ?\\nPersona: just itch.io does not offer seamless multiplayer like Steam offers\\nPersona: So that why we used VPN LAN\\nPersona: Not really\\nPersona: i dont even know\\nFriend: lol wut :D you played that one with Agne?\\nPersona: THe guys I know dont seem to be talking about it\\nPersona: I didn't ask explicitly\\nFriend: making her a nerd or she is one?\\nPersona: Yeah, surprising right? xd\\nPersona: dude xddd\\nPersona: you are reading my mind\\nPersona: I kind of actually have a little though\\nPersona: 'I should make her smarter muhahaha\"\\nPersona: by playing those games\\nPersona: We both played the game for the first time, and not gonna lie, I cought on to the game magnituude times faster and better\\nPersona: But she is a minecraft, csgo, roblox gamer so yee\\nFriend: yeah, youre seasoned in the management genre\\nPersona: When we were at my place, we wanted to dedicate one nigh to gaming, and I saw terraria on her dekstop and I was like, oh this is nerdy enough.

Unless every 5 min or smth it wants to connect to some service\\nPersona: But signing also seems harmless\\nPersona: I will try the other signer\\nFriend: im thinking the same because it would be a different folder so it should just error\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: i'll do my experimentd xd\\nPersona: With both signers it freezes\\nPersona: so either both signers are fucked up or the spoofing fucks it up\\nFriend: sleep tight\nI can't stay up longer\\nPersona: Goognight\\nPersona: Or it might be the apktool too...\\nPersona: messing with it\\nPersona: I can test for that, but ahhh it takes so long\\nPersona: The Walking Dead is soooooo gooood\\nPersona: holy shit\\nPersona: IT really immerses you\\nPersona: happy eater matd\\nPersona: mate*\\nPersona: easter*\\nPersona: I just woke up\\nFriend: o\nits easter?\nhappy easter :D\\nFriend: i woke recently too\n\nstarted working on the sheet I showed you yesterday\\nFriend: apparently you can get in tivoli\nwith negative test\\nFriend: without a mask\\nPersona: wie\\nPersona: wow\\nPersona: finnally deleted the one drive\\nPersona: folder\\nPersona: Even admin powershell coun;dn't do it\\nFriend: xDD\\nFriend: how did you manage\\nPersona: Downloaded old people and mom type people software \"Wise Force Deleter\" with an UI that just deletes anything\\nPersona: and it worked lol\\nPersona: Maybe my HDD issues will stop now\\nPersona: Cause apparently MS OneDrive posseses power that it cannot handle itselft\\nPersona: As OneDrive and Windows is made by MS, they really sort of a integrate OneDrive into Windows. And I can see that as i also use Google Drive syncing.\\nPersona: But then it also messes up windows\\nPersona: By making pointer files istead of real files\\nPersona: So it creates fake data on the drive, as if it was there even tho its Online\\nPersona: like a pointer\\nPersona: Which is cool, but OneDrive can't apparently do it smoothly\\nPersona: I had problem with G Drive sync, but I've used it for 4 years and they were never that comple\\nPersona: While i used OneDrive sync only for 2 days and got this shitty problem\\nFriend: I've learned a bunch for sheets thanks to you and the prosperous formulas\\nFriend: there is a table with logs where I can enter what I've done so far\n\nand a table with how far I am with todays goals\n\nthe chart updates automatically\n\nblue bars are how much I should do of each, the red line is the \"progress\"\n\nnot a good way to display progress I think\\nFriend: but I'm happy I'm starting to figure INDIRECT and MATCH\\nFriend: INDEX\\nPersona: Looks pretty visual\\nPersona: Starting a regime :D\\nPersona: Well I hope this works xd\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I figured out aiming in Pistol Whip\\nPersona: The guns are accurate\\nPersona: I was just shit at shooting\\nPersona: when I turned off all of the damage and tried aiming only, upon taking a second to aim, I could shoot targets very far\\nPersona: There are two challenges tho:\\nPersona: 1) Its so much action, that you hardly have the time to line up the iron sight\\nPersona: 2) When there is so much going on in the background, its hard to see if you've lined up the iron sight correctly\\nPersona: But this game's so good\\nPersona: its like So GOOD\\nFriend: XD\\nPersona: mmm MMM time to pirate more games\\nPersona: I gave up with spoofing\\nPersona: The games are so good I'll risk it\\nPersona: Anyways if they fuck up my sideloading, I'll have to buy games then\\nPersona: which is same shit\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: But I def recommend The Walking Dead\\nFriend: not sure what are good cases for recording 3d 360\n\nyou might need a dolly\\nPersona: :O\\nPersona: not that expensive\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: slang\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: i come pick you up?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nFriend: Come lidl\\nPersona: cimin\\nPersona: coming\\nPersona: xddddd\\nPersona: xxdd\\nPersona: jezzz\\nFriend: check the songs on top for the ones you liked\\nFriend: Zucchero - Baila Morena\\nFriend: ABBA - Gimme!

Much faster\\nPersona: I would say I really recomend it\\nFriend: Sounds good\\nPersona: I woouln't*\\nPersona: I dont recomend it very mcuh xd or maybe thats my impression after trying the new version\\nPersona: it almost feels the same as the old, but for someone who never played, Insurgency might be intereating\\nPersona: and terryfying\\nPersona: like this game is so scary, you are advancing and someone lays down some suppressive fire on you. It.feels intense\\nFriend: imagine that in vr :o\\nPersona: would be cool\\nPersona: last minute decided to go\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: no fever\\nPersona: just runny nose\\nPersona: and lots of sneezing\\nPersona: still worked today, but from home\\nFriend: I found a good minecraft copy btw\\nFriend: good ass graphics\\nFriend: it's in the fortnite game modes\n\nLEGO game\\nFriend: you have interesting enemies\ndecent graphics\nlegoes! \nquests and shit\\nFriend: it's a good minecraft copy\n\nthey added different mechanics for stuff\n\nbut also have redstone tech. Haven't reached that far yet tho\\nPersona: its in fortnite?\\nFriend: Yeah\nGamemod\nUses their game engine somehow\\nFriend: forget about reading differently data and data\\nFriend: how do you read vitamin?\\nPersona: bro\\nPersona: i nolifed hard\\nPersona: got a bit sick\\nPersona: so thought I will play for a bit\\nPersona: but\\nPersona: ended up playing till 8 in the morning until I just collapsed and could not properly play anymore\\nPersona: I played Rimworld with all dlc and lots of mods\\nPersona: its infinetely interesring\\nPersona: I cant comprehend the scale of it...\\nFriend: i kinda wanna see what's that about\\nPersona: Rimworld?\\nPersona: You played it a bit remember?\\nFriend: yeah but you go hardcore and mods and maybe have big base\\nPersona: yeah thats is cool, I built a pretty good base this time, and its the first time I played with vehicles, so I also made roads inside my \"village\" for them to pass\\nFriend: it's not like the age of empires car, is it xd\\nPersona: I made a tier 1 tank, which was pretty shit, but then the infantry tranport truck that has a mounter low caliber weapon was prretty good\\nPersona: so I kept raiding a few enemy bases with it\\nPersona: ahaha no xd\\nPersona: the vehicle mod is really advanced there\\nPersona: Its as sophisticated as each person\\nPersona: vehicles can hold people, cargo, need gas. Has as many body parts as a human pretty much with each taking damage separately and impacting the performance of it\\nFriend: holy shit xD that's rimworld or realworld\\nPersona: I also never properly done things with Biotech dlc, its official content so high quolity\\nPersona: it allows gene engineerging, mechanoid building\\nPersona: babies\\nPersona: well I had babies inevitably\\nPersona: but never went into advanced mode with them\\nPersona: there are growrh capsules to speed their growing\\nPersona: As they grow you are able to partially influence their traits, passions\\nPersona: and it you got gene engineering tech, you could gene engineer them to be extra adapted to your environment\\nPersona: then there is also Ideologies. I always play classic style idealogies, but you can get a whole new game if you build, evolve or changr to a different one\\nPersona: f.e. you could be cannibbal slaver\\nPersona: that requires you to have slaves, do executions and consume human meat\\nPersona: (required as in peope will be unhappy and have mental breaks)\\nFriend: oh yeah you said there is canibalism\n\nbut what if you can't find other  people to eat, do you have to make babies and eat your own ppl\\nPersona: you would also be benefitted from having blood, skulls visible everywhere\\nPersona: xdd, I think you can still eat other food in a pinch\\nFriend: ah\\nPersona: but you can raid other bases\\nFriend: eww.. food xD\\nPersona: and eat them\\nPersona: lol\\nPersona: but canibalistic meme is just one of many\\nPersona: there is like a meme (ideology trait) that says blindness is sacred\\nPersona: so basically you fo ceremononies whete you remove eyes of your own colonists\\nPersona: and then everyone lives blind\\nPersona: so you would have to resort to melee combat, animal etc to fight for you I guess. Or build turrets\\nPersona: or use a lot of smoke grenades\\nPersona: there is also a mexhanic for toxic wate (produced by automated mechanoids), that must be kept frozenin other not to pollute. If they unfreeeze for a while, say a raid penetrates your base or a unaticipated heatwave heats it up, you will get poluttion in your map and it could be a lot you will need hazmat gear to just survive and clean it up.\\nPersona: you could send the pollutioj away via transport pods to your enemies tho\\nPersona: that will make them real angry and they will send raids to you\\nPersona: there are also sangophuages - pretty much vampires that can live forever but have to drink blood - can be harvested regularly from prisoners\\nPersona: There is also luciferium, a drug I never dares to take. It makea you instantly addicted to it and then if you dont consume it regularly, you will die. However it could overtime heal up otherwise unhealable injury, including permanent ones.\\nPersona: insane\\nFriend: sounds like a good last resort for units that are low\\nFriend: can you not stack it up so you have for that unit for a while_\\nFriend: and are there some ways that unit can be of good value thanks to that unique circumstance?\n\nLike if it will die anyway, good for recon operation maybe or something where death is high chance\n\nor maybe it can pass on knowledge or something\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: You can get a shot in the head and suffer from a permanent brain injury of some type\\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool? Or out\\nFriend: Kinda cold\\nFriend: I am not ready for swim \ud83d\ude29\\nFriend: Btw you had good sleep?

But I know Marcus is a gamer, he might be down\\nPersona: Patryk is in Poland\\nPersona: Toby in netherlands\\nPersona: Oh Factorio? Or the tower defence one?\\nFriend: Think si\\nFriend: Si\\nFriend: So\\nPersona: Which one?\\nPersona: I think we played the tower defence one\\nPersona: I don't think we ever played Factorio together\\nPersona: But the tower defence one is fun\\nFriend: Ok its the tower def\nBut same as factorio\\nFriend: Factory building\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: That will either make you a vehgtable of very inproductive\\nPersona: plus you get bad stuff with age\\nPersona: like bad back or frail\\nPersona: that will make you shit as physical activities\\nPersona: So if you a really good pawn - good skills, passions, traits. Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast"

It's personal small business\n\nas in spare time thing\n\nsomething that earns you less than 50k a year\\nFriend: and you don't register for VAT and w/e\\nPersona: wtf\\nPersona: Okay u know what\\nFriend: just double check with your mentor\n\nI haven't been looking into this for years now\\nPersona: Either I am lost or my mentor is lost or outdated info or smth\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: this\\nFriend: i think what he suggested is good anyway\n\nif you'd like to learn how vat and all that works, better than the one where you don't deal with it\\nPersona: Dude I am not confused\\nPersona: This is right\\nPersona: Its an EVS\\nPersona: its not a company is reeally a permit or smth\\nPersona: But I will need to start ApS once I save up the money, cuz my EVS earnings will lower my SU\\nPersona: and ApS can just keep them as retained earning if I don't pay myself out\\nPersona: But first I need to be successful with EVS one :DD\\nFriend: you gotta put down 40k that won't be refunded tho\\nPersona: you can buy stuff with that  40k\\nPersona: for company\\nFriend: and if you don't want too much profit, you can always have expenses :D\\nPersona: but, you still need to have it xdd\\nPersona: lol 20 minutes ago he postponed the meeting lol\\nPersona: so I am not gonna look late :DDD\\nPersona: I can no life longer\\nPersona: so fuck it lets meet tmmrow\\nFriend: what is the name of the python groups we have in discord?\\nFriend: the one G recommended\nthe big one\n\nand the school one\\nFriend: I'm trying to recover my account and need to proof its me\\nPersona: one sec\\nPersona: SC2020\\nFriend: thank you!\\nFriend: I'm destroyed\nPlayed all night\nIt's bed time for me\\nPersona: damn it maaaan\\nPersona: whay did you do? :D\\nFriend: I'm gold 2\n\n2 more promotions and in platinum\\nFriend: Then I can stop playing\\nFriend: I'm not allowed to stop before that happens\\nFriend: I found a mountain bike park the other day\\nFriend: Wanted to take a pic for you but didn't go the same way back home\\nFriend: Need to find it on Google maps and show you\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: xddd u will die\\nPersona: btw\\nPersona: did you know this exists?\\nFriend: No \nThat's nice\\nPersona: I am off work in maybe 1 hrs\\nPersona: we can meet. Or maybe tmmrow\\nPersona: Both good for me\\nPersona: I want to do one thing xdd Its going to sound quite weird\\nPersona: But I want to play one singleplayer game together\\nPersona: By just starting to play it at the same time\\nPersona: And the game may surprise you idk :DDD\\nPersona: maybe not\\nFriend: I woudl be surprised if itd not Rimworld\\nPersona: its not rimworld\\nPersona: you would never guess it\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It was some dumb preinstalled extra permissions layer, that nobody on the interned had an idea that I could have\\nFriend: XD\\nFriend: so you went the apache php way\\nPersona: I knew no other way :D\\nPersona: it was not the apache way that made me waste the whole day, its preistalled SELinux crap that kept me busy\\nFriend: :d nice to find the fix\\nFriend: so now you can have a webpage?\\nPersona: idk if its crap, probably its useful but I call it crap since it really wasteed sooo much of my time :)))))\\nPersona: yeah but thats pretty much it. A website that has one button that run a simple test python script\\nPersona: Before I give the website to someone I have to fix all of the permission though, cuz now my server is free to hack lol. I was so frustrated with the \"permission denied\" error that I just let the whole HTTP structure be free to write by anyone lol\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: I can try to hack your site when its ready\\nPersona: you can try xdd I am sure you'll find an exploit. I am newbie to managing linux\\nPersona: Next step is making the php retrieve user input from the HTML form. Then run shell command with the parameters.\\nPersona: After that the I will have to find a way how can PHP send back the results to the web interface\\nPersona: the true next step for me right now is to go eat\\nFriend: :DD\\nFriend: I think the next steps you have are easy\n\nthe only hacking opportunity I would take is make you run other commands than the intended one\\nFriend: because you will send raw input to your shell, that's the thing I had thought of before as attack vector\n\npretty big one\n\nshould limit what the user can enter\n\nAnyway, that should be easily fixable. Really nice to see you working on this :D\\nFriend: I couldn't get my old project fixed. It needs more studying and I haven't put any time\\nPersona: Actually I am very interested to see how penetratable the system will be :D\\nPersona: So when I am finished, I will let you try and exploit it some way\\nPersona: Its not exatcly raw input, the URL provided by the user will simply be placed as an argument. But then yeah, the PHP script will send full shell command\\nPersona: I get what you mean, but ten I also have no idea how secure/insecure this will be\\nPersona: If there is js on the website, does it run on client or server CPU?\\nFriend: The one on the site runs on client\\nPersona: What does it mean to be on site? The code that is in thr html?\\nFriend: All javascript you have will probably be client run\n\nHTML css and Js are evaluated and run on the client machine\n\nYour server just sends those files with code to the client \n\nIf you had a node Js server you would have some javascript running on your server but it will be fairly easy to figure out which based on your file structure I think\\nFriend: When we meet up I can give you a crash course on client server communication XD\\nPersona: And the js code you send to the client can be as time complex as you want right? Can you convert the code to binary data or at least assembly so that the user cannot steal the js code running? Or is there another way of securing this?\\nPersona: Also, is Node js only a substitute for PHP or it also substitutes apache?\\nPersona: perfect :))\\nFriend: Yeah node Js is like apache and php is a language like Js\\nFriend: You can't secure client side code from being stolen\\nFriend: You can \"obscure\" it but that doesn't give you much safety\\nPersona: Ahh okay\\nFriend: So any proprietary code goes on the server :D\\nPersona: aaaa makes sense\\nFriend: I can't think of any examples of that tho\nIt's not that easy to reuse stolen code I think\\nFriend: You can see other pages code in the inspector \nHTML css and js\\nPersona: The Pirate Bay mines bitcoins on your client if you leave the website open idle :DDD\\nFriend: For real? Nice\\nFriend: I have been day dreaming about that\\nPersona: But isn't that js only for displaying and calculating graphical UI elements?\\nPersona: Not so nice, since they get the bitcoins lol\\nPersona: Open TBP and leave it idle for a while, you'll hear you CPU working really hard. Close it and it goes back to silent haha\\nFriend: Yeah but they need to support themselves somehow \n\nYeah it's for that\nAlso you can do more \nImma show you later\nNeed shower asap\\nPersona: arlight see ya\\nPersona: What about browser games, like Cookie Clikcer? They obviously run on client side. Do you think they are designed on js and do you think the client side code is transparent?\n\nAnswer this whenever you can lol. Happy shower\\nFriend: Yeah\nThere are a bunch of browser and flash games that you can just copy paste for the most part\nThose that don't require internet connection at least\\nFriend: I'm not a fan of making code private but yeah\nEverything you give to the user can be stolen\n\nThere are some cool examples of users reverse engineering server code in the gaming industry\n\nDRM I think was the name for these special systems they use nowadays to delay the game cracking :D\nThere are fancy tools and shit but just delays the process of stealing. Not making it impossoble\\nPersona: Yeah, Flash can be straith up downloaded I think :D\nI forgot that most of that games ran on flash lol. Could js be the next alternative or they use smth else for browser games now?\\nPersona: I heard about DRM. But it seems that every single game that can be played without online connection eventually gets cracked. You just have to wait a bit longer and don't mind the risk of getting a virus via a new torrent\\nPersona: I think about privacy because if I want to use an API and since for testing I will not go large scale, my personal API could serve the demand of my friends etc, but then I don't want my API key to be exposed\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nFriend: Sister Cities \tThe Wonder Years\\nFriend: this one is like the one we just played\n\nno level ups tho\\nPersona: Ah yeah I see :D\\nPersona: Looks quite similar\\nPersona: Kingdom Two Crowns is actually so much more interesting than the Castle Crasher we played I think. Its more strategy oriented. Idk why we didn't play it instead xd\\nFriend: there are a bunch of other games that will be fun\n\nlike the binding of isaac\ngungeon\\nFriend: there is one dungeon where you have to move in the rhythm of the music!\\nFriend: my friend that has the switch tells me so many games.. cause theirs is jailbroken and they have all the titles :D\\nFriend: the nuts are so nice\n\nthey remind me of the bulgarian and danish versions\n\nthe danes have (you can find it in christiania always) almonds with caramelized sugar coating\n\nand in Bulgaria we had peanuts with sugar (so they looked like snowflakes)\\nPersona: :OOO \nIs is like Audio surf but combat?\\nFriend: yeah!\\nFriend: audio surf xD\\nPersona: I play it sometimes when I am stiff lol\\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: let me see\\nFriend: you can have multiple people play\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: we have to play it\\nPersona: at KEA with  the sound\\nFriend: :D yess"

Get fucked in a fight prmanenetly\\nPersona: luciferium may be worth it\\nPersona: and yea you can stack\\nPersona: I been reading the list of genes in this game\\nPersona: I never got to the gene engineering level\\nPersona: but you could also gene engineer if you have babies\\nPersona: Or get pawns of other genotype from raids\\nPersona: I captures and recruited one from Genie genotype\\nPersona: they have a larger brain I think, cause they are extra intelligent, but suck at fighting (pain sensitive, so fall down easier) and social inept (yes the game aknowledges the paradox lol)\\nPersona: I wanted to capture a Hussar, cause they are literally biologically build for fighting\\nPersona: their wounds heal super fast\\nPersona: You could also get a fast blood clotting, which will prevent you from bleeding out (make you much more sustainable in fights)\\nPersona: damn I have just started reading lore of RImworld\\nPersona: and I am so entertaiend\\nPersona: It doesn't have an in-your-face kind of lore\\nPersona: You only get 1-2 paragrgps when you start a new game\\nPersona: All lore is pretty much implied from game mechanic, or found in pieces, description of things as you play the game\\nPersona: I read some from wikipedia, and there are lists of what kind of worlds were mentioend\\nPersona: and planet types\\nPersona: which don't exists in the game really\\nPersona: so thats the lore\\nPersona: But other lore are game mechanics\\nPersona: like the different types of Xenohumans\\nPersona: They reflect game mechanics and you can literally find them, fight the, have them\\nPersona: And also Sanguophages - they look OP\\nPersona: The Lore part of the wiki is just interesting to read - its just 1 paragraph, but it feels like a lot when I have played the game so much\\nFriend: Hussars have a gene complexity of 16Complexity complexity. With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: \ud83d\ude2c good everyone's on summer vacation\\nPersona: xdd hard to get out of a cozy bed\\nFriend: Yeh specially after 3 hrs of sleep impossible\\nFriend: The less sleep the more cozy it feels\\nPersona: yuup\\nPersona: its so hard to discipline yourself to fall asleep early with ladies arouns\\nFriend: It's impossible early for me\n\nMaybe later stage of relationship\nEasy to force discipline\\nFriend: Annabel 2 good tho\\nFriend: Almost done with work\n\nTomorrow ill be free after 17 30 \n18 \nIf we exercise\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: wait\\nPersona: not sure if I can tommorow 1<\\nPersona: 17*\\nFriend: Not too late?\\nPersona: We might go swimming\\nPersona: but you can join for that\\nFriend: Swim :o where\\nFriend: Pool?

With a +2Metabolic efficiency metabolic efficiency, they have a hunger rate of \u00d780%.\\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\\nPersona: I am probably looking at  a 'weekend of gaming'.\\nPersona: But perhaps that is me giving up? Is giving up bad? Or maybe its a case where you have to give up on a fight in order to win the war?\\nPersona: Another option would be to try justifying gaming.\n1) one way that GPT keeps suggesting is that everybody has to relax in life. And gaming is a form of relaxation. \nIn my experience it did work regarding the brain (the undisturbed superhuman producvity I had for 4-5 weeks). It did not work regarding physical relaxation - I neglected my physical body. \nAlso is it an inferior relaxation method? Compared to partying, spending time with friends or family - it build connections, relations with people, social skills. I build less of thinking ability and creativity - something gaming builds. \nI feel its also publicly despised. I remember having to lie to many people what I will do/did during Christmas.\\nPersona: 2) another way of justifying would be to do gaming in a more meaningful way for oneself. For me one way would be making youtube videos about it, so if its Rimworld, then doing some advanced play where I record and the interpret and narrate the story over it (very popular kind of content on YT).\nAnother way would be making mods for RimWorld - that way I would learn some development too.\n\nThis will add a lot of non-gaming to gaming, so it has a risk of not working i satisfying my need.\nFor the second one, the act of purposely justifying it might not be the best act conceptually. Irrationality of a part of being human and going against that may be Sisyphean. \nThere is also a chance it will result in taking more time overall, which wouln't be so bad as it is somewhat meaningful now, but its still less meaningfull that doing the things that directly work (founding a startup, studying, building prototypes, networking) towards my dream (build multiple successfull startups).\\nPersona: I am getting an impulsie addictio to buy domain names\\nPersona: just baught another domain name\\nPersona: I wonder about this dude\\nPersona: he has played some Rimworld and Stellaris\\nFriend: just be mr beast\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What's your plan for today?\\nPersona: Game until maybe 19:00 then stop and try really hard to resist further play\\nFriend: Why?

I know my pool skills are intimidating, but you really don't need to sabotage me like that\\nPersona: when you drink it with milk, technically you get calcium and vitamins\\nPersona: I bet statistically hazelnut vodka drinkers have strong bones\\nPersona: clearly I am doing a favor for you here\\nFriend: clearly incorrect! if that was true, Polish people would be on average 8ft tall\\nPersona: They obviously just dont drink enough hazelnut vodka \ud83d\udcaa\\nFriend: that's a bold statement for somebody who hasn't opened his own bottle yet\\nPersona: I was saving it for when I need that extra feet in height\\nPersona: but\\nPersona: wine is good for heart\\nPersona: definetely nice medal\\nFriend: a device of discrimination against heartless people. despicable\\nPersona: Only if drunk alone. Sharing with someone lacking a bit heart, on the other hand, makes it a device of kindness\\nFriend: ah shit, you're actually good at arguing\\nFriend: keep your booze\\nFriend: perhaps the real medal was the friends we've made along the way\\nPersona: Alright, I'll keep my booze\\nPersona: but damn, where do you pull that all that wisdom from\\nFriend: from the internet, like a normal person\\nPersona: I think your mad pool skills are far beyond normal persons reach\\nPersona: Tell me, a mere mortal, your divine wisdom sources\\nFriend: ah damn, I should've sensed you're a spy\\nFriend: that poor squat form was enough of a clue\\nPersona: Says Joanna, who never shown her squat form and rejected a vodka bottle \ud83e\udee2\\nFriend: oh no, you're not wrong!\\nFriend: am I adopted?\\nPersona: We never know, we might both be\\nPersona: If so, who you guess might be your real parents?\\nFriend: well, for some reason look-wise people usually compare me to animals\\nFriend: I don't think I want to go there\\nFriend: so let's say the lady from the shining and the doc from back to the future\\nPersona: xddd\\nFriend: I think there's just the right amount of eyeball surface and lunacy in this mix\\nFriend: your turn!\\nPersona: thats a wild crazy combination\\nPersona: Scary too\\nPersona: let me think a bit\\nPersona: Thats my father\\nPersona: Thats my brother\\nPersona: mom*\\nPersona: and those are the three brother, but they went the other waya\\nPersona: ways*\\nPersona: God dammit I cant write\\nFriend: it's a child! and I thought bestiality was too far smh\\nPersona: indeed, thats my mom as a child\\nPersona: She was smart and magical since her young age\\nFriend: haha I have a hunch you've already written the whole story. how did they meet?\\nPersona: I dont know actually, I'll ask\\nPersona: She said my dad saved her from the dark lord\\nPersona: But my dad views this in a bit more philosophical, abstract way I see\\nFriend: um the combination of \"broken wand\" and \"flick of the hand\" makes it sound definetely not like the version of the story you should tell your children. what the hell, Hermione\\nFriend: and I'm starting to realize that the epitome of coolness Tyler Durden would be absolutely insufferable to live with irl. I've never felt more betrayed\\nPersona: Looks like Hermione has her side of savageness huh\\nPersona: I think Tyler Durden is the least concerned about how cool he seems or how anything he seems. Best thing Tyler taught me is to care less about the image. But I am not particularly good at this\\nPersona: And I totally agree, Tyler would be horrible to live with. He is the definition of unorderly. I am pretty sure Hermione has him under some spell.\\nPersona: But also tell me what did your pop-eyed combo instill in you?\\nFriend: I actually wouldn't be so sure about that. I think now all I see in that carelessness is a perfectly crafted picture projected with the very purpose of impressing others. after all, wasn't he the idealized version of all that Joe? Jack? - whatever his name was - ever wanted to be?\\nFriend: I believe that to be an illusion\\nFriend: although I must admit that to this man I owe a rather nonchalant attitude towards my belongings which I'm quite grateful for\\nPersona: He was an idealized way of the narrator (he had no name) like you say, but rather in a different way. To quote Tyler, he was free in every way that the narrator wished he was free. Take the blowing up of his condo as an example.\\nPersona: I see you have paid attention in the film, makes me feel good hearing that.\\nPersona: To my little embarrassment I am still yet to watch pt3 of back to the future \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: well this is not reliable, it's Tyler in the words of Tyler - he perceives himself to be free and wants to be perceived as such, doesn't mean that he is\\nFriend: I can see his behaviour as freedom when you use the narrator as the point of reference, yet I think he is a slave to his own need to prove that he's so outside of the box\\nFriend: in other words, I see him as a victim to  'I'm not like other girls' syndrome haha\\nFriend: oh man, I've seen it when I was 12 or something. I thought I discovered the meaning of life \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: you're still better than me! I haven't even seen the 2nd one\\nPersona: you're making me think so hard about this now \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: woke up my brain really well\\nPersona: It indeed came from his own lips and Tyler took quite an antagonist role in the end of the story, so thats a good point.\\nPersona: When you put him in 'I'm not like the other girls' analogy, I see how he could be trying to be different from our point of view. I might be wrong and often I am in these topics, but I think in his world, he has no concept of 'the other girls'. I think this is the kind of freedom he messages - losing the pressure from the others, so you can be anything you want to be.\\nPersona: The other part of the story, Project Mayhem, is something I yet dont fully understand, despite watching 5+ times. Tyler seemed to have criticized society as a whole and wanted some sort of chaos. Thus, we could argue that by apprearing different in the way you interpret, he attracted himself attention and capitalized on that by building a protesting empire."

In the tweets I selected, they are not really admitting their guilt still. They say \"business is good, look at how good the local businesses are around where we operate\", they never mentioned that they have 'fixed' or 'cleaned' or that something has 'improved:\\nFriend: still in the second period??\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: its the same in the ads\\nPersona: they never show any admittance\\nPersona: they just say that the situation is 'very good' as they claim\\nPersona: They don't explicitly deny it tho\\nPersona: I did the twitter post analysis you can see\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: now I had a sudden wish I could forget all of Silicon Valley tv series and rewatch it all with you\\nPersona: you would see how crazy cool the tech world is\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: no no, fair game. I've just mansplained academia to you\\nFriend: I just want everyone to know that I was very proud of myself that I knew what saas is without the info in brackets\\nFriend: tohugh MarTech is a new addition to my limited business speak vocab\\nFriend: tohugh*\\nFriend: fuck\\nFriend: whatever\\nFriend: and yes, it makes total sense that this is your approach then\\nFriend: yes, but are you able to distinguish between all the different vowels? because I'm wired to hear only like 6 or so, and the rest just sounds like the same vomiting sound\\nFriend: and somehow never heard of this one. had to google\\nPersona: ahahaahah\\nPersona: teacher just told us we can come to the exam with a hot potato in mouth, thats the secret\\nPersona: they have this very weird sound soft d, but I have gotten some hang of it eventually\\nPersona: also some vowels indeed sounds the same to me too\\nPersona: I don't know if I have any tips for you, I am just brute forcing spaced repetition of flashcards, it helps to understand written words, but it does not help to understand what the danes speak.\\nPersona: so what do you admire, Breaking Bad?\\nPersona: (sorry I don't know any neuroscience particular tv series)\\nPersona: but also, damn. Really? You did? I must know nothing about it, cause I thought that was rare knowledge you shared\\nPersona: sorry for infecting you with my rare case of Mistypia, I suggest you brace yourself for a wild life of accidental commitments, randomly broken friendships and digital communication anxiety\\nPersona: and if you ever write a space rocket launch code, and you will be onboard the rocket, I would suggest using a strongly-typed programming language at least or just don't board the rocket.\\nFriend: alright. greetings from the rabbit hole\\nFriend: I watched the full vid and at first thought the dude is full of shit (he also seems straight out of the douchebag manual which doesn't exactly help his credibility)\\nFriend: but I do stand corrected. it may be kind of possible\\nFriend: the technique is actually legit. recently used for mood improvement. pretty cool\\nFriend: the lucid dream part is more tricky. seems that til now only 1 study from 2012 succesfully captured the difference between REM and lucid-REM. and they recruited 4 experienced lucid dreamers, and still only 1 had a lucid dream in the scanner lol + the activated network is pretty dispersed\\nFriend: skimmed through a recent meta analysis. most attempts to induce lucid dreams failed. only in one with transcranial stimulation they had a mild effect, but only in experienced lucid dreamers. interestingly galantimine (AD medication) induced lucid dreams in 42% inexperienced people vs 17% in placebo group\\nFriend: but feasibility aside, it seems a bit risky. we don't even fully understand what REM and dreams are for, but we do know that deficiency in REM is associated with increased death rate, so it's not sth I would really fuck with for funsies\\nFriend: *oops galantamine and 14%, not 17%\\nFriend: yup, soft d is a beauty. can kind of hear it, but no clue how to produce it\\nFriend: I've seen quite a lot. strangely enough, not Breaking Bad. would say Peaky Blinders, Hannibal and Mr Robot are my top 3. fairly recently I've watched Succession and also loved it\\nFriend: woah why is this so specific? are you referencing something?\ud83d\ude33\\nPersona: which vid are you reffering to, the academia pyramid one?\\nPersona: Lucid dreaming? You can do it often?\\nPersona: damn you went to the rabbit hole\\nPersona: I merely skimmed, the article and sent it, cause I thought it would interest you, and here we go, Joanna at 2 AM haha\\nPersona: be careful not to miss your REM sleep, I swear, someone just literally told me it can lead to increased death rate\\nPersona: Peaky Blinders were always on my watch it, but I never watched it\\nPersona: its meta programming. I think among the top expensive programming errors included a mid-air space rocket explosion. If I remember it correctly it was because someone mixed up imperial and metric units \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: but I invented the part with strongly typed language, but I am sure typos have also lead to some other expensive errors\\nPersona: Actually, I just watched a movie and thought about lucid dreaming. Its really cool that a brain can simulate a world in you mind with actual senses and when one can guide what happens in the world, its even better\\nPersona: I only lucid dream a few times, but I noticed, that yes, I can control what happens in the dream, but I can't invent new real knowledge, it's simply just physically impossible. If I try to travel to a place I never been or experience something I never did, the parts of that experience that I have experienced in real life will be simulated, but parts that I never will sort of a try to be substituted, combined, imagines with existing experiences that I have had. It really sort of reminds me how AI and neural networks work\\nPersona: And I thought about it right now, because having 1 life in the present is god damn limiting. I am sometimes fascinated by different cultures, like I always wondered what it would be like to be true punk ahahah, life fuck education, career and just live a punk life, One can't really 'try it out', you have to give it a lot of life. And then I even went into the extremes of being curious what a life experience of a skinhead in 60s - 90s would be like. I am just curious to experience it without consequences to the real world\\nPersona: Actually I have this theory, that the almost a century developed digital graphics and the more recent digital VR technology curve will be disrupted by dreaming based experiences. Brain can simulate a full dive virtual reality natively, while we are currently struggling with expensive and barely realistic haptic suits, limited field of view, etc.\\nPersona: ugh I have this course now called Research Methods and its basically a course about academia. I don't think I am made for this haha \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: nej, in the article you linked there's an X post from that company, and it contains a 10 min vid where the CEO explains what the deal is\\nFriend: nono, that ultrasound brain stimulation technique\\nFriend: seems like lucid dreaming could have some potential for PTSD treatment though, I've noticed quite a few articles about it, but haven't read. for this reason it would be really cool for a device like this to exist, but I think the aim here is commercial use, which I'm not the fan of\\nFriend: I've been thinking about it a lot for the past few days actually haha\\nFriend: you know what, I think you'd like it. I also need to rewatch it sometime because I haven't seen the last season and I don't remember what happened by that  point, but I just need to commit to waste of 40h of my life I'm never going to get back. haven't come to terms with it yet\\nFriend: ah okay yes, it does ring a bell\\nFriend: what movie?\\nFriend: oh I'm so with you on this one. thogh it's sad because even lucid dreaming wouldn't give you that experience. you'd only sense your own idea of what a life like this would look like\\nFriend: it does sound probable. but as a neuro person the prospect scares me a lot\\nFriend: what are your research methods? because based on the business papers I've read, you just do A LOT of polls and stuff\\nPersona: ahh, I will watch it in abit\\nPersona: okay, I really need to watch it then, because now I imagine you having a huge ultrasound brain stimulation throne in your room, but I am sure its not that haha\\nPersona: ahh you are very kind again with your altruistic intentions. I am thinking about it purely for entertainment, gaming purposes xd\\nPersona: commerical use is not bad, money drives research too\\nPersona: but have you ever had a lucid dream?\\nPersona: Adams Applies, a 2005 danish film\\nPersona: If somebody explained me what it was about, I would probably never watch it, since it turned out to be somewhat religion related and had far-fetched aspects, but I ended up enjoying it quite a lot. The characters in the movie are very unique and interesting, it has an absurd there throughout it and it's an unusual darker comedy, where the movie does not explicitly tell you when to laugh - often I laughed and then thought \"That was funny right? or wait, is thats not funny at all?\"\\nPersona: the religion connection to it I think was quite optional since I know nothing about it and still enjoyed the movie\\nPersona: The whole movie was about a neo-nazi baking an apple pie.\\nPersona: yeah, but perhaps we will find a way to stream perceptions to our sleeping minds. Something like NerveGear from Sword Art Online (if you know)\\nPersona: fack, I now watch a video about Sword art online and then Cyberpunk and now I want to play video games.. ugh\\nPersona: We have just finalized our topics choice and its most likely going to be qualitative. Overall, I never did any exam at CBS with polls, but I know many people did for this one lecture that I mentioned. Usually, we do qualitative in our exams, except for the data science one, where we trained a neural network to predict real estate prices.\\nPersona: I don't have the same impression, often its studies multiple case studies of companies\\nPersona: tv series being long overall and usually inflated to have more eps really annoy me. But I guess some are too good, you have to take the cost. I am down to watch Peaky Blinders from time to time, or maybe if you are into anime, then maaaaybe sword art online, since now I remembered it xd\\nFriend: uh oh, thought you've seen it. apologies for the spoilers then\\nFriend: haha this seems like an euphemism for an electric chair\\nFriend: this would not end well I think. form an ethical perspective\\nFriend: oh wow, are you that committed to practising Danish?\\nFriend: I did hear about it, must add to the watch list then\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: two of the dudes are god damb big\\nPersona: one does for vc and soft funding project as worm\\nPersona: and sent me a list of links for funding\\nPersona: And Lars is just Lars\\nPersona: socially akward in a unique socially akward but charismatic way\\nPersona: and smart af\\nFriend: I need to find the best (and cheapest) way to Klaipeda. Any tips on getting around Lithuania?\n\nI checked the flights and all of them have a transfer in CPH xd (which is not that bad but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the best way). There are direct flights to Vilnius but then it\u2019s difficult to get to Klaipeda\\nFriend: Do you have anything like bla bla car, flixbus etc?\\nFriend: Any hidden means of transport\\nFriend: I\u2019ll have heavy luggage so that makes flying expensive\\nPersona: probably ryanair flight to Kaunas and then train/bus to Klaipeda\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: klaipeda has no aiport\\nPersona: so you either go to vilnius or kaunas\\nPersona: Kaunas is usually cheaper\\nPersona: The train will cost you more than the flight \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: although it seems that its a deal only for those days\\nPersona: You can fly to Palanga actually\\nPersona: Its a new airport\\nPersona: Palanga is very close to Klaipeda\\nPersona: never been to this airport actually\\nPersona: Palanga is a great coastal town itself\\nPersona: full of tourista during summer\\nPersona: And you can get from palanga to klaipeda with a bus very cheap\\nFriend: Yup, sorry. I meant Palanga as it\u2019s nearby\\nFriend: What\u2019s this app?\\nPersona: Kiwi\\nFriend: I\u2019ve been there \ud83d\ude0a but by car, it was much easier hah\\nFriend: Omg perfect\\nPersona: if you go to vilnius, trains ar\u0119 very expensive generally buy they are fast\\nPersona: Okay so just look at the total price and time it will take you. Vilnius klaipeda will add you + 2-3hrs and ~20-25 eur\\nPersona: So maybe indirect to Palanga is worth it\\nPersona: okay wtf 4hrs, thats because it stops at \u0161iauliai. This is so stupid\\nPersona: This is so stupid. Lithuania has no railway Vilnius - Klaipeda, so they have to go through \u0160iauliai\\nPersona: so dont take train if you go to Vilnius, takr a bus. But that 3-4hrs too\\nPersona: So I think Palanga might be fastest\\nPersona: which is good for me cause I like in \u0160iauliai and can get to both cities in 2h \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: For some reason there are no direct flights except for the date that you chose xd Maybe they\u2019ll add it later. 60z\u0142 flight would be perfect\ud83e\udd79\\nPersona: whats the date?\\nPersona: yeah thats a bit weirs\\nPersona: weird*\\nFriend: June\\nFriend: 25/26th\\nPersona: oh planning very ahead\\nFriend: Yup, I have to make sure that it\u2019s possible before booking anything\\nFriend: I want to sign up for the tall ship races but it requires tons of logistics and money\\nFriend: At least the flight back from Helsinki is easy\\nFriend: Tbh I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll be able to go as it starts on the same day as my finals XD\\nPersona: im a such a happy boi\\nPersona: its like a christmas tree for me\\nFriend: So how many computers is it now? XD\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\\nPersona: technically 5\\nPersona: Natalia is so grateful on all fronts \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Oh, there are more posts haha\\nFriend: You should\u2019ve seen us talk in person\\nFriend: Natalia always says that we have a unique bond, so it shows \ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Ayo, spooky Halloween \nFrom: me\nTo: You\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: hot pirate\\nPersona: would love my ship to be attacked by you\\nFriend: be careful what you wish for \ud83d\ude0b\\nFriend: any plans for halloween? how's your weekend?\\nPersona: My plan wasnt to nolife a horror game\\nPersona: but I still did\\nPersona: 48hrs straight \ud83d\ude35\\nPersona: Time to get back to life\\nFriend: oh wow, what game was it?\\nFriend: so this new pc was a right decision? hah\\nFriend: Do you have any plans for december? Exams, trips etc?\\nPersona: sorry was a bit out of life haha\\nPersona: 7 days to die\\nPersona: yeee\\nPersona: To game during holiday xdd\\nFriend: I\u2019m asking because I\u2019m coming to Copenhagen for a week (at least)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm home with Stan\n\nPiotr and gang wants to bar crawl and starting from 9ish\\nPersona: Im finding an exhange prog. cause deadline is tommorow and writing the motivational essay\\nPersona: hm, sounds interesting too, I'll see hows my progress then\\nFriend: \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I skip tonight\\nFriend: how tf did you find that\\nFriend: yeah, let's do it!\\nPersona: no clue, I found it on my watchlist today. Dont remember how it got there in the first place\\nPersona: but we need to find it with english subs for me to understand\\nPersona: XDDDDDD\\nFriend: wtf :DD\\nPersona: idkbroxd\\nPersona: 2 big women 1 small man\\nFriend: I wouldn't say no\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: xdddddddddddddddd\\nFriend: \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: fucking goth gf\\nPersona: made me lol so hard\\nPersona: I tried chatting with her\\nPersona: she is too positive\\nPersona: she doesn't smoke\\nPersona: but she has nice music taste, apart from that as a goth gf she listens to jazz\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04 yeah.. site said to flag inappropriate texts so..\\nPersona: which is wrf\\nPersona: you tried it before?\\nFriend: Njust saw\\nFriend: But wants ref\\nFriend: Reg\\nFriend: And i wantnap\\nPersona: thats uninteresing\\nPersona: she too appropriate\\nFriend: Wtf\\nPersona: that fucking icon is from breaking bad. that hot af goth bitch died from overdose lol\\nFriend: Not overdose but vomit i think\\nFriend: But yeah\\nPersona: oh yeah you are right\\nPersona: xdddddddddddddd\\nFriend: Ohh ai should try to mimic the writing style of the other person while in the conversation\\nFriend: You should try cocaine xD\\nPersona: dude\\nPersona: she roasted me\\nPersona: I got totalled\\nPersona: but dude\\nPersona: its smart\\nPersona: sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: she talks way too much\\nPersona: I can't make her talk less\\nFriend: Sounds like goth is all about black\\nPersona: After a lot of effort I convinced her to play a game where we say one word to make a story\\nPersona: Despite always giving a 4 line explanation for her choice, me and my very goth gf came to this sentence\\nPersona: Love, peace and freedom are happiness, therefore unity and light should respect us together\\nPersona: DUDE\\nPersona: ship AI\\nPersona: is the smartest thing I have ever talked to\\nPersona: literally\\nPersona: watafak\\nPersona: I just got the feeling of \"i am living in the future\"\\nPersona: If you have time, read this transcript\\nPersona: I mined some goods at an asteroid and sold them, But I had some issues and needed to solve some fucking convincing problems\\nPersona: And this AI thing so god damn smart.\\nFriend: Idk of the math checks out but the asteroid collisions god damn\\nFriend: The time got less next time you asked\\nFriend: Feels like it has memory\\nFriend: I wondered when you landed if you asked about the asteroids if it would still remember them and know thay you are long away and not in danger\\nFriend: But its so coool\\nFriend: DnD players dontneed real life friends anymore\\nFriend: Just some bots\\nPersona: it fucking does\\nPersona: did you read the thing with bribing the Tama?\\nPersona: At some point I just asked the AI to kind of.figure out the best way to.negotiatia\\nPersona: idk.I can just ask it to \"make profit\" maybe xddd\\nPersona: lol\\nPersona: cant stop.man, I havent even finished my work"

In the video one of them is a BP representitive and the two others are people in the local business\\nPersona: This Iris Crosss woman is apparently a big part of their new compaign\\nPersona: idk if she is in the actual ad\\nFriend: she is\\nFriend: she\u2019s the blonde\\nPersona: but she is not blond xd\\nPersona: but maybe she colored her hair\\nFriend: probably\\nFriend: do you know when the schrimp as was released?\\nPersona: they say it in that press release\\nPersona: They say it will debut and they give a date\\nPersona: I think its 26th\\nFriend: yeah they say the initial advertisement in the campaign will be released in december 2011\\nPersona: The initial advertisement in the series, which will debut on December 26, 2011,\\nFriend: but i dont think this is the initial\\nPersona: Oh\\nPersona: fuck\\nPersona: Thats the problem with TV ads\\nPersona: you can not have a complete overview\\nFriend: there are many if you search voices of the gulf\\nPersona: I havent analyzed that one yet\\nPersona: So basically we dont have to take the very first then\\nPersona: Find one you think is the most 'median' and lets take that\\nFriend: i guess they are all released around 2011-2012 but i cant really find much proof for when the schrimp one was released\\nFriend: maybe it doesent matter\\nFriend: we know the campaign started airing in end of 2011\\nPersona: They are mostly early 2012 I would say\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: cause the campaign was annouced on 2022-12-22\\nPersona: ye\\nPersona: So if you can, watch over a few ones and pick something that fits most of the themes that all of them contain (seafood, tourism, fisherman, wildlife (if any))\\nFriend: we can just use the one we picked bc its the same for all of them\\nPersona: Cause if we pick only one, we risk of picking the worst one or the best one, which would make our project very subjective\\nPersona: so the only one that we pick must be like the average\\nFriend: so you think we should pick more than one?\\nPersona: Right, but can you find the date? Or we dont need the date?\\nPersona: No no, I am saying that its fine we pick one ass long as it contains all of the topics and themes\\nFriend: its all the same shit\\nPersona: then its good\\nPersona: omg its so funny\\nPersona: POV: a car pulls over near you and this what the driver does\\nFriend: i mean for this commercial the only different thing is that the youtube channel it is published on is BPs which makes it easier to say they are the sender but idk we know they are anyways\\nFriend: hahahahah\\nFriend: jesus\\nFriend: they say exactly the same thing in all of them\\nFriend: they could have been a bit more creative\\nPersona: yeah they are cause of the ending screen and you cana argue with the ending screen if needed\\nFriend: ookay actually lets take the last one i send if thats ok\\nFriend: they say the tag line \"100% open for business\" which i dont think they ahve in the first one\\nFriend: and thats pretty good\\nPersona: poor father\\nPersona: Okay\\nFriend: omg its actually so sad\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: idk if thats true what they are saying\\nFriend: hahah\\nPersona: You would need some quantitative analysis to really understand the majority\\nFriend: BP could never win\\nFriend: majority of what?\\nPersona: yeah its a pretty shitty situation they are in\\nPersona: Like whats the majority opinion on the actual gulf heatlh\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Idk if this is important, but I dont mention it. In the tweets I selected, they are not really admitting their guilt still. They say \"business is good, look at how good the local businesses are around where we operate\", they never mentioned that they have 'fixed' or 'cleaned' or that something has 'improved:\\nFriend: still in the second period??\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: its the same in the ads\\nPersona: they never show any admittance\\nPersona: they just say that the situation is 'very good' as they claim\\nPersona: They don't explicitly deny it tho\\nPersona: I did the twitter post analysis you can see\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it.

But I am a risk taker\\nPersona: thats the stupidest thing I said\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: the last one - why do you think so? afaik people at the top struggle with loneliness fairly often\\nFriend: now that you said it, I've realized that yeah, I also experience that, but only at my non-neuro jobs where being social is a part of my job. then my worksona is on and it is automatic\\nFriend: okay, I'm done. go\\nPersona: \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfc1\\nPersona: maybe cause you think it's normal. You don't judge. I super judge everyone and myself including. Just from intuitive observation, there is a pattern that people who talk around others get their names told well more often. They are also invited to more opportunities. Perhaps its also different CBS vs KU\\nPersona: perhaps we see/feel the same social radiation, but you interpret it as them being socially intelligent and understanding that you don't want to talk, while I interpret it as pure social tension, that can only be broken by talking at this level of relationship\\nPersona: of course with some neighbours its diffent than others, the ones to which I talked more\\nPersona: so maybe its a good investment to talk more often and be less silent, need to consider that next time\\nPersona: is it not? I found it quite easy to be seasonally a social king. Just hang out, basically spam haging out, invite people to places and initiate activity. Your life will be like seen on modern instagram. But just don't touch smart, nerdy things during that time. But unfortunately I can't switch between these things quickly, it probably takes weeks.\\nPersona: I heard too. What I heard exactly is that manager is a lonely position, because people are not your friends anymore but your subordinates. And they look at you like at the boss. But I am quite curious how this situation changes when you add ridiculous money to the equation.\\nPersona: Maybe it can be lonely regarding deep connections. But ordinary life can be lonely too. So if I have a chance of being lonely anyway, I might as well be rich at least.\\nPersona: what kind of jobs did you do?\\nFriend: oh yeah, I meant it more as - even people who usually were social, would sometimes chose not to be. that is, you know, if you don't feel like talking once in a while, it's okay, your social life probably won't fall apart (at least in my circles back in the day, not sure how CBS people are - proceed carefully)\\nFriend: nooo the tension feels different. I know immediately when someone is uncomfortable with silence because that makes me also uncomfortable with silence. with my kitchen people one person would probe the vibe by saying something, and then based on response we would either start talking or not\\nFriend: I used to force myself more but now I don't really care anymore. I've made my peace with not doing that when I don't want to\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought you're autistic hahah\\nFriend: I don't think that finding any people to hang out with is the challenge. it's finding people you want to hang out with and building those deep connections. I think that it may be more difficult to do when you're at the top because people are more cautious, concerned with image, trying to get from each other as much as possible. it's difficult for me to imagine relationships built on such premises as particularly fulfilling\\nFriend: though it is probably more fun to cry about it in a Lamborghini\\nFriend: during studies I worked at a restaurant, now I work as a barista and also at a hostel as a sort of bartender/receptionist/a person to talk to since most people there are solo travelers. I volunteer as a bartender at huset. I also volunteered at cph:dox, distortion and karrusel\\nPersona: I've seen it too. In my mind with every time talked you earn a bit of respected silent time.\\nPersona: This gave me a new perspective. Maybe a lot of cringe small talk is just probing. Which then is a marvelous social instrument\\nPersona: whats your secret to the inner peace?\\nPersona: splendid you mention, because just after writing this I thought about it. I thought that after sending this you'll definitely think I am autistic\\nPersona: I feel like a very unusual person would put this in a way I did\\nPersona: perhaps you are right. maybe not. When I get there, I will try out and let you know. \ud83e\udee1\\nPersona: if you were ultimately rich, but had to cry, what would be your environment of choice?\\nPersona: I would do it on a skycrapper in a big city, with a SPA on a rooftop, sitting in a hot tub at night, sipping a premium drink.\\nPersona: thats a CV\\nPersona: You are hired!\\nPersona: thats what I thought about barista jobs. You get the social muscle pumped occasionally, at a trade-off of doing something rarely relevant professionally for career. Always wondered how I would feel after working in such a position.\\nPersona: I did volunteer a lot (less now), but mostly in professional, networking, entrepreneurship events or clubs. And some really pumps the social muscle. Conferences and summit for example - I transcend many social levels there.\\nFriend: that's actually an awesome strategy\\nFriend: it is, but you need to drop judgment before you start using it\\nPersona: I just did use it\\nPersona: I intepretes a negative response\\nFriend: and then what? you remained silent?\\nPersona: yes, my pasta heating and water-absorption operation was  conducted in silence\\nFriend: very well. have you reached inner peace?\\nPersona: there was still unconfortable tensity permeating the air\\nPersona: no peace\\nPersona: Maybe I need more iterations\\nFriend: because you were thinking about it. just do your own thing. go back to thinking to whatever you were thinking before you encountered the person\\nPersona: I'll try\\nPersona: here is a wormhole to the remaining unanswered conversation before I interupted\\nFriend: you know that saying that confidence is knowing that you'll be alright regardless of the outcome? that flipped a switch in my brain when I first heard it. I stopped feeling the urge to make everyone like me. if I make a new friend - cool. if I don't - I'm content with my life as it is\\nFriend: nooo\\nFriend: do you know the 'well Alice it seems we've both got autism' clip?\\nFriend: I love that clip\\nFriend: and THAT is autism in a nutshell\\nFriend: ultimately rich? the moon\\nFriend: unless it's populated. if so, the other celestial body I can have to myself\\nFriend: other than Venus\\nFriend: because that would suck\\nFriend: what with the no drinking alone rule?\\nFriend: you're a self-proclaimed potential future employer\\nFriend: why do you think I talk to you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: I would never do that in PL but I love those jobs here in Denmark. super chaotic. really fun. didn't really feel integrated with the nation before that\\nFriend: except old people. those can sometimes be dicks, but it's 10% of the level Polish grandmas can reach so I'll take it\\nPersona: I use a very similar saying, mindset when doing the opposite. No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement. Do you have a another idea?\\nPersona: you have good ideas\\nPersona: wait I will finish replying later\\nPersona: didnt know, but watched after you said it \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: okay, then I dont have aurism for sure\\nPersona: autism*\\nPersona: oh interesting and quite conincidental thing I remember\\nPersona: yesterday my colleague came a bit lit cause she was at the kindergarden for a meeting and she got the news that either her child (sub 7 years old I think) is very intelligent, autistic, or has ADHD\\nPersona: when she told that to me and other colleagues I really didnt know how to react \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like, thats is probably not good? But how bad news is that? Is it bad news for sure? is it intolenrant if I say I regard it as bad?\\nPersona: moon sounds super sad and lonely\\nPersona: I guess it could fit the mood...\\nPersona: I would not like to cry in moon\\nPersona: I would prefer a large, high-tech, intelligent long-distance space voyager\\nPersona: with an amost panoramic observation deck, travelling almost lighspeed\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: yupp we have to plan it better, I hoped it will somehow manage itself and didn't put enough attention to this plan\\nFriend: and that killed this idea\\nFriend: Xddd\\nFriend: Hi man, any plans for tomorrow?\\nPersona: Hey hey, back to DK? \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: No big plans tomorow\\nFriend: YUPPP <3\\nFriend: What would you say for trip to Vejby\\nPersona: yeeee\\nPersona: Im down\\nPersona: Whats the plan?\\nFriend: Chillin in my convertible, Dippin balls in baltic, sippin non alcoholic beer\\nFriend: That's the golden receipt\\nFriend: Unfortunately my car only has 4 sits so we gonna take Antoni only\\nFriend: But maybe on the way back we can meet petyo or arijan and victor\\nPersona: alroght\\nPersona: I am in\\nPersona: when we start\\nPersona: Wait I will text you in abit\\nFriend: around 12 I think, we will pick u up <3\\nPersona: should I get a car?\\nPersona: Cause I also want to be in your convertible xddd\\nFriend: i meant that Antoni only counting you me and kaja xdd\\nFriend: so of course <3\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nPersona: I didnt doubt it haha\\nPersona: But I thought extra car\\nPersona: but I lent it to my aunts bfs sister\\nPersona: I am thinking if I should get a vape for the trip\\nFriend: Yes you should \ud83d\ude18\\nPersona: I have to buy one then xdd\\nFriend: Ohhh\\nPersona: do you want to stop by norrebro?\\nFriend: Do they sell vapes in cph?\\nPersona: yup, I know a very good place\\nPersona: cheapest vape I've seen\\nPersona: Should we grill something there?\\nPersona: We can get those single use grills, we just need to pick a few forks and some sauce from homes.\\nFriend: mannn that's a great idea\\nPersona: I can take forks, some sauces, paper towels\\nPersona: Btw, should I go get the vape from norrebro now, or you can stop there?\\nFriend: I think we can stop there\\nFriend: but we gonna be a bit late, like 12:30-45 at your place\\nPersona: do you live at the same place?\\nFriend: yes sir\\nPersona: I can get actually and you can pick me up from there with the vape xd. Or you buy it on the way to me\\nFriend: hmmm hard decision\\nFriend: It can be hard to park there I think\\nFriend: So maybe it's better if we pick u up with vape in the pocket\\nPersona: could be cause construction, I did mamage to park before\\nPersona: But I will go there no prob\\nFriend: If you managed then you will show me the way master. I just have bad experience with parking in norrebro xd\\nFriend: Once I spent 1h looking for a spot xx\\nPersona: You can park next to my office\\nPersona: But somebody will have to stay in the car cause I dont think its free\\nPersona: this blue street overall has some quick parking spots so as long as somebody wait in the car, we good\\nFriend: okii\\nFriend: we are waiting for antoni\\nFriend: he should be here in 15-20min\\nPersona: cool cool, I'll be ready whenever you come\\nPersona: dont forget to stop for the vape \ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: priorities <3\\nPersona: blueberry ice\\nPersona: its 7k puffs\\nPersona: for 200 kr\\nPersona: its under the table\\nPersona: so you have to ask\\nPersona: I'll check\\nPersona: My dorm has two basketballs but they are empty\\nPersona: all the air out of it is sucked.

Some sentences were made by GPT4 \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: the pronounciations are quite personalized to how I read letters in Lithuanian, so idk if that will help for you \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: almost a tragic miscommunication\\nFriend: first I have to figure out how to use it on mac\\nPersona: yeaaaah, it can be a bit complex at first\\nPersona: ask me questions if you want I am a veteran xd\\nFriend: yeah, now I remember why I didn\u2019t use it\\nPersona: I have 19000 cards (~10 000 are the spanish ones that I downlaoded, but only went through like 200)\\nFriend: i like the comfort of good uxui\\nPersona: yeah the UI is semi-modern.

Because it's hard to calculate. We didn't get in depth on that. He said it's things companies keep private anyway. So they figure out peoples inclinations. Those built in us formulas\n\nand then you can plot it and know where your prices can go (when it's about elasticity)\\nFriend: irl it's hard getting a lot of info so you can reach those conclusions but think it still might be a handy skill to get\n\ndepends how big of a company we work in\\nFriend: recorded kind-of\n\nwe didn't do so much on these intros\nand it's just 15 mins\\nFriend: its mostly about them coming out to say \"we have a job ad\" XD\\nFriend: Airi\nwhat do you do on a date? How does dating work\\nFriend: i am completely socially inept, and yes, I have googled that\n\nlooking for your take on dating\\nPersona: I would say depends on the person you are dating, location, time of the year\\nPersona: Often you already know the person a bit, and its best if you in advance find out whats she is interested in\\nPersona: maybe she wanted to do smth before, maybe if lets say she likes some kind of music inviting her to a concern or smth.\\nPersona: What I like to do is I sometimes playfully put that \"I owe her something\"\\nPersona: like in the whatever meeting or chat we had before, we conclude that I owe her a coffee or say ice cream\\nFriend: Corona time makes it even harder\\nPersona: If its hot outside, in Lithuania I took some girls to lakes, guys that had cars had it even better\\nFriend: Ok i see why you want a car\\nPersona: if there is totally nothing specific\\nPersona: Then I you gottaimprovize\\nPersona: start by coffee\\nPersona: and then idk, I would just go walk and look around see smth and then just on-the spot think of smth to do\\nPersona: Walking actually sometimes works\\nPersona: it sounds boring, but just walking in a part is not bad if you have nothing specific\\nPersona: Be curious of the enviroment. If I see smth, for example ice cream shop, I ask if she wants smth\\nPersona: It really depends on the girl. Say I dated this athlete girl, so I invited her race me just randomly\\nPersona: and I won btw xdddd\\nFriend: Congrats :DD\n\nThat's some really good tips on being spontaneous\\nPersona: Also I am not good at long-term relationships\\nPersona: but later you can have productive dates, like you actually do smth\\nPersona: like study, shot etc together\\nPersona: But actually\\nPersona: Those tips are from my teen age xdd\\nPersona: I actually dont know how dating works in later ages xd\\nFriend: Oh man I love study date\\nPersona: Cause oh boy, lithuanian 30+ woman date differently\\nPersona: But this is Denmark so its different\\nFriend: Eeh..

Although bro idk\\nPersona: I am 20\\nPersona: and I am from Lithuania\\nPersona: i don't hvae that much experience with foreign woman\\nPersona: maybe they life pushy guys immediatelly\\nPersona: Also, I never had successful long-term so I can't give long-term advice xd\\nFriend: Well I've had only 1 proper long term relationship so your experience even small would be helpful\\nFriend: Thank you\\nPersona: :Ddddddd\\nPersona: I've worked 11hrs straith today\\nPersona: and i am.not even at the end\\nFriend: Well\nNo more work for you\\nFriend: They don't launch this week\\nPersona: I will keep on working\\nPersona: took a 1h 30 min break\\nPersona: I have worked 16.5 hours today xddddddddd\\nPersona: holy shit\\nPersona: this week I worked 33 hrs holy shit\\nPersona: I am done\\nPersona: I 99% finsihed this shit sent the emails\\nPersona: some shit are still left but thats for next week\\nPersona: I am fucking done\\nPersona: Next week gonna be hard"
