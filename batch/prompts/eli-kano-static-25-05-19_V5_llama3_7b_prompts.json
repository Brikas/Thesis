So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.

So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches.
