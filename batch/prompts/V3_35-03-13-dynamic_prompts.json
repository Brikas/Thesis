Notion is much better.\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\\nPersona: yo wtf\\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\\nPersona: click the three dots\\nPersona: and there is install app button\\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\\nPersona: thats pretty cool\\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\\nPersona: and mortgages\\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\\nPersona: and the problem with not talking is thay it is embarassing for me\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Do you still have the one on 5-7 or sth?\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: Hmm ok, but what does it mean exactly? How much time is it going to take you daily?\\nFriend: Approx\\nPersona: I will try to prepare before hand as much as I can\\nPersona: much with my track record of exams, it will take me 24hrs a day xd on 5th, 6th, 9th,10th,11th\\nPersona: I will try to study a lot this month, so I can go through them smooth\\nFriend: Ouch\\nFriend: But it\u2019s ok\\nFriend: Do what you have to do, no worries. Tbh studying/working while you\u2019re studying wouldnt be an issue for me\\nFriend: I can always go to the maritime museum and be a nerd all day long \ud83e\udd20\\nFriend: Oh btw, my brother recommended me a place\\nFriend: Tisvilde\\nFriend: Nothing to see there except for nature. They have a beach and troll forest xd\\nFriend: AND the cutest tiny holiday houses\\nFriend: Could you convert it to pdf? It doesn\u2019t work and I know that pdf\u2019s do.\nFor a few extra kisses \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Can be anytime\\nPersona: Eyy sorry, I forgot it, I will convert it tommorow \ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: What you\u2019ve been up to?\\nPersona: Probably this is the last weekend in Denmark with very good weather\\nPersona: so whole weekend of fun \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Friday it was Antoni birthday\\nPersona: we went out and bbq\\nPersona: Yesterday party at Arijans in Nordhavn and a little swin\\nPersona: Today lake trip\\nFriend: Omg XD\\nFriend: Was it a bday gift? Magnifique \u2728\\nPersona: yup xd\\nFriend: Are the polish friends still in cph? The guy with bmw\\nPersona: no no\\nPersona: its romanian dude\\nFriend: Oh, idk why I thought that they\u2019re polish xd\\nFriend: Have fun \ud83d\ude0a\\nPersona: Cause I have many polish people around me\\nPersona: but not too many xd\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: woah why is this so specific? are you referencing something?\ud83d\ude33\\nPersona: which vid are you reffering to, the academia pyramid one?\\nPersona: Lucid dreaming? You can do it often?\\nPersona: damn you went to the rabbit hole\\nPersona: I merely skimmed, the article and sent it, cause I thought it would interest you, and here we go, Joanna at 2 AM haha\\nPersona: be careful not to miss your REM sleep, I swear, someone just literally told me it can lead to increased death rate\\nPersona: Peaky Blinders were always on my watch it, but I never watched it\\nPersona: its meta programming. I think among the top expensive programming errors included a mid-air space rocket explosion. If I remember it correctly it was because someone mixed up imperial and metric units \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: but I invented the part with strongly typed language, but I am sure typos have also lead to some other expensive errors\\nPersona: Actually, I just watched a movie and thought about lucid dreaming. Its really cool that a brain can simulate a world in you mind with actual senses and when one can guide what happens in the world, its even better\\nPersona: I only lucid dream a few times, but I noticed, that yes, I can control what happens in the dream, but I can't invent new real knowledge, it's simply just physically impossible. If I try to travel to a place I never been or experience something I never did, the parts of that experience that I have experienced in real life will be simulated, but parts that I never will sort of a try to be substituted, combined, imagines with existing experiences that I have had. It really sort of reminds me how AI and neural networks work\\nPersona: And I thought about it right now, because having 1 life in the present is god damn limiting. I am sometimes fascinated by different cultures, like I always wondered what it would be like to be true punk ahahah, life fuck education, career and just live a punk life, One can't really 'try it out', you have to give it a lot of life. And then I even went into the extremes of being curious what a life experience of a skinhead in 60s - 90s would be like. I am just curious to experience it without consequences to the real world\\nPersona: Actually I have this theory, that the almost a century developed digital graphics and the more recent digital VR technology curve will be disrupted by dreaming based experiences. Brain can simulate a full dive virtual reality natively, while we are currently struggling with expensive and barely realistic haptic suits, limited field of view, etc.\\nPersona: ugh I have this course now called Research Methods and its basically a course about academia. I don't think I am made for this haha \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: nej, in the article you linked there's an X post from that company, and it contains a 10 min vid where the CEO explains what the deal is\\nFriend: nono, that ultrasound brain stimulation technique\\nFriend: seems like lucid dreaming could have some potential for PTSD treatment though, I've noticed quite a few articles about it, but haven't read. for this reason it would be really cool for a device like this to exist, but I think the aim here is commercial use, which I'm not the fan of\\nFriend: I've been thinking about it a lot for the past few days actually haha\\nFriend: you know what, I think you'd like it. I also need to rewatch it sometime because I haven't seen the last season and I don't remember what happened by that  point, but I just need to commit to waste of 40h of my life I'm never going to get back. haven't come to terms with it yet\\nFriend: ah okay yes, it does ring a bell\\nFriend: what movie?\\nFriend: oh I'm so with you on this one. thogh it's sad because even lucid dreaming wouldn't give you that experience. you'd only sense your own idea of what a life like this would look like\\nFriend: it does sound probable. but as a neuro person the prospect scares me a lot\\nFriend: what are your research methods? because based on the business papers I've read, you just do A LOT of polls and stuff\\nPersona: ahh, I will watch it in abit\\nPersona: okay, I really need to watch it then, because now I imagine you having a huge ultrasound brain stimulation throne in your room, but I am sure its not that haha\\nPersona: ahh you are very kind again with your altruistic intentions. I am thinking about it purely for entertainment, gaming purposes xd\\nPersona: commerical use is not bad, money drives research too\\nPersona: but have you ever had a lucid dream?\\nPersona: Adams Applies, a 2005 danish film\\nPersona: If somebody explained me what it was about, I would probably never watch it, since it turned out to be somewhat religion related and had far-fetched aspects, but I ended up enjoying it quite a lot. The characters in the movie are very unique and interesting, it has an absurd there throughout it and it's an unusual darker comedy, where the movie does not explicitly tell you when to laugh - often I laughed and then thought \"That was funny right? or wait, is thats not funny at all?\"\\nPersona: the religion connection to it I think was quite optional since I know nothing about it and still enjoyed the movie\\nPersona: The whole movie was about a neo-nazi baking an apple pie.\\nPersona: yeah, but perhaps we will find a way to stream perceptions to our sleeping minds. Something like NerveGear from Sword Art Online (if you know)\\nPersona: fack, I now watch a video about Sword art online and then Cyberpunk and now I want to play video games.. ugh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: daily finance should get fully automated now\\nPersona: oh btw this chich from.techbbw\\nPersona: He looks decent and\\nPersona: Can code\\nPersona: But 7/10 maybe 8/10\\nPersona: here she looks hot, but irl not as much as I remember\\nFriend: card looks good!\n\nalso I'm thinking now\n\nit's a lot about history maybe that their app is password protected\n\nand because it was set up like that once long time ago, it would be too much upfront cost to change it maybe\\nFriend: why put it there? faster to ripen?\\nFriend: bangladesh chick\\nFriend: good linkedin skills\\nPersona: yeah, sun\\nPersona: xd\\nPersona: xd\\nFriend: am a bit racist\nbecause I had one Bangladesh guy in my class with a weird finger\\nFriend: check her fingers man\\nPersona: xdddd\\nPersona: weird finger\\nPersona: she has polished nails\\nPersona: I will check her fingers tommorow\\nPersona: Xdddd sounds so.weird\\nFriend: :D\\nFriend: better safe than sorry\\nPersona: XDDDDDDDDDDD\\nPersona: You there still?\\nPersona: What do you think about this LI post?\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: is that yours?\\nFriend: quite good tip to meet first day \n\nand then second day\\nFriend: I was too scared to go first\\nPersona: yeah I just posted now\\nFriend: some really good insight\\nPersona: Toook me like 2-3 hours to conceive\\nFriend: I wish I knew this earlier :D\\nPersona: I went from smth really preachy and generic, like \"i been to techbbq, hire me' mode, to smth that adds value to the reader actually\\nPersona: And I was worried that I am posting too late about this, but actually I used posting 2 weeks as an advantage by adding this line:\n\nRetrospectively, I almost fully checked off these challenges while volunteering at TechBBQ. And these were the interactions that retained the most value for me two weeks after the event.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I guess it depends on the programme\\nPersona: yaah\\nPersona: Hey\\nPersona: when is somebody home today?\\nFriend: I am returning rn\\nFriend: So ill be home round 17:30\\nPersona: alright, lets stay in touch\\nFriend: \ud83d\udc4d\\nFriend: I am home\\nPersona: good\\nPersona: im omw\\nPersona: Hey, good decision to make a party - always fun \ud83d\ude0a. I have a friend from Lithuania coming over that weekend for short time so I am not what I'll be doing. Maybe I will talk to her and if thats okay with you, I could also bring her to your party?\\nPersona: Thanks for inviting also\\nFriend: I am sure someone won't be able to come so it should be fine if you bring her \ud83d\ude0a\\nPersona: Alrigjjt, thanks I'll let you know then\\nPersona: Hey, Laura, happy birthday \ud83d\udc9d I hope you're having a great party tonight and we can't come today, but tommorow if you are home we still want to bring you a gift that we got for you \ud83d\ude07\\nPersona: Maybe in the morning\\nFriend: Awww\\nFriend: That's ok\\nFriend: Im hone the whole day tomorrow \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\\nPersona: Make sure you enjoy tonightt!!\\nPersona: Hey, hows the party :D ? You are not planning to sleep anytime soon right?\\nFriend: Hahaha\\nFriend: I am cleaning\\nPersona: we are on the way\\nPersona: Hey\\nPersona: maybe nexus tonight?\\nPersona: hm hm?\\nFriend: Oooh\\nFriend: Didn't see\\nFriend: Sorry\\nFriend: Nope, I am moving this weekend\\nFriend: I went to ikea today and I still have a pwp to do for tomorrow lol\\nPersona: ah alright alright\\nPersona: do you need help moving tho?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: nooooo now i am having second thoughts again\\nFriend: i can\u2019t go through it again hahah my whole day has been me stressing abt that choice\\nPersona: yeah, my colleague studied it and its really good for the bridge role between tech and business too. I also checked the courses, it has some really good content\\nPersona: ahahahah sorry, don't worry\\nFriend: stop it\\nFriend: say it\u2019s boring\\nFriend: i can\u2019t do this again\\nPersona: its boring af, my colleague is a total boringass dude\\nPersona: glad I dont have to take this inno course\\nPersona: I applied to Digital Business too\\nPersona: the topics are great, but for the programming part is kind of too weak, so the main idea of the course to get an understanding how software is build is kind of irrelevant to learn as I already know\\nPersona: My colleague currently studies DB and she often talks about it, she also asks me about programming, but she is doing quite fine\\nFriend: i am so sad\\nFriend: hahahah\\nFriend: bro\\nPersona: ey why?\\nFriend: bc i decided yesterday to do the MIB and then last minute today i changed my mind after spending so much time roaming around it\\nFriend: fuck it\\nPersona: I did the same with information systems\\nFriend: now i did it i\u2019ll survive nonetheless\\nPersona: I was already writing a motivation letter\\nPersona: and then midway I was like\\nPersona: fuck it, I dont want it, it sucks\\nFriend: i just decided to send it bc it took too long for me to decide\\nPersona: oh wait, so basically, you are only sad, because you took the more demanding option and now you are being a pussy and being scared?\\nPersona: you have commited to it - you will do it\\nFriend: excatly that\\nFriend: i am a pussy\\nPersona: if my colleague can do it, you can do it\\nPersona: you can definetely do it then\\nPersona: you will learn to make a full-stack web application\\nPersona: thats really cool\\nPersona: when you have the million dollar app idea you will be able to do\\nFriend: i dont even know what that iiisss\\nFriend: i hope i will have a million dollar idea\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its a new airport\\nPersona: Palanga is very close to Klaipeda\\nPersona: never been to this airport actually\\nPersona: Palanga is a great coastal town itself\\nPersona: full of tourista during summer\\nPersona: And you can get from palanga to klaipeda with a bus very cheap\\nFriend: Yup, sorry. I meant Palanga as it\u2019s nearby\\nFriend: What\u2019s this app?\\nPersona: Kiwi\\nFriend: I\u2019ve been there \ud83d\ude0a but by car, it was much easier hah\\nFriend: Omg perfect\\nPersona: if you go to vilnius, trains ar\u0119 very expensive generally buy they are fast\\nPersona: Okay so just look at the total price and time it will take you. Vilnius klaipeda will add you + 2-3hrs and ~20-25 eur\\nPersona: So maybe indirect to Palanga is worth it\\nPersona: okay wtf 4hrs, thats because it stops at \u0161iauliai. This is so stupid\\nPersona: This is so stupid. Lithuania has no railway Vilnius - Klaipeda, so they have to go through \u0160iauliai\\nPersona: so dont take train if you go to Vilnius, takr a bus. But that 3-4hrs too\\nPersona: So I think Palanga might be fastest\\nPersona: which is good for me cause I like in \u0160iauliai and can get to both cities in 2h \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: For some reason there are no direct flights except for the date that you chose xd Maybe they\u2019ll add it later. 60z\u0142 flight would be perfect\ud83e\udd79\\nPersona: whats the date?\\nPersona: yeah thats a bit weirs\\nPersona: weird*\\nFriend: June\\nFriend: 25/26th\\nPersona: oh planning very ahead\\nFriend: Yup, I have to make sure that it\u2019s possible before booking anything\\nFriend: I want to sign up for the tall ship races but it requires tons of logistics and money\\nFriend: At least the flight back from Helsinki is easy\\nFriend: Tbh I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019ll be able to go as it starts on the same day as my finals XD\\nPersona: im a such a happy boi\\nPersona: its like a christmas tree for me\\nFriend: So how many computers is it now?

What times you up for? Ill look at projections in a minute\\nFriend: Think there are 11 14\\nPersona: whats the location?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: by what she seees? what do you mean?\\nPersona: disguised?\\nPersona: or disgusted?\\nFriend: disgusted\\nPersona: oh xdd\\nPersona: usually she is very confident in front of camera\\nPersona: She is from my hometown\\nPersona: she was always like max rep. But she is definetely ugly without her social reputation and charisma/confidence\\nFriend: weird how it's self feeding\\nPersona: what do you mean self feeding?\\nFriend: feedback loop\n\nthe more social rep/charisma/confidence, the better perceived you are\nand then that boosts it even more\\nFriend: it's so much about perception. Companies and people\\nPersona: yup\\nPersona: like wtf is this\\nPersona: i see this\\nPersona: i run\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude05 reminds me a bit of the one with the long hair\\nFriend: that comes out from the TV\\nFriend: horror movie one\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: yh\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd23 what\\nFriend: why\\nFriend: silly adobe\\nPersona: no clue\\nPersona: I like the car\\nPersona: I need to make big money and get a good car\\nFriend: many pledge allegiance to the GTR\\nFriend: I see you're a fan too\\nPersona: looks nice.

Was thinking that I could pick you up from work, will rent a donkey bike\\nFriend: Do you still want to go for billard? Or maybe bouldering? If we want to meet up with people I think it\u2019s best to ask today\\nFriend: And I want to take you on a ramen date \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: We can go out on Tueadau\\nPersona: cause danish class today\\nPersona: And biliard sounds good. For ramen, what about going for Pho instead?\\nFriend: yess\\nFriend: I had pho with Liisa and it was great\\nFriend: today I can make the potaoes + (non)meet and salad\\nFriend: unless we\u2019ll have time for pho between work and class?\\nFriend: do you think I can go to cbs library?\\nFriend: without you it feels illegal xd\\nPersona: hey sorry idk why my phone didnt ring\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: it nvm it was not you\\nPersona: you most definetelly can\\nPersona: if noone sees you leave, I think its not too bad if you leave the door unlocked\\nFriend: .\\nFriend: What do you want for dinner?\\nPersona: I dont think 1 hours is enough for that\\nFriend: ok\\nPersona: Potatoes? \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: yup!\\nFriend: then I\u2019ll stay at home today\\nFriend: ate brownie and nuts for breakfast xd\\nPersona: I am suuuuper sorry for forgetting to leave the key\\nPersona: hope that was fine\\nFriend: yup, im fine\\nPersona: Should I get you anything on the way home? \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: Hmm don\u2019t think I need anything\\nFriend: But thank you\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I was volunteering\\nPersona: its inside cph\\nFriend: Was there anything that surprised you the most?\\nFriend: Idk, it just seems like a big event and you didn\u2019t say anything about it\\nPersona: that they hate japaneese\\nPersona: and that the japaneese did a 30mil genocide on the chineese\\nPersona: and then erased it from book and denied it\\nPersona: while germany admitted it so the world is fine with the modern germany, but unlike japaneese, who never aknowledged their mistake\\nFriend: Japaneese stole ramen from them so im not surprised\\nFriend: Oh damn, when was it? WWII?\\nPersona: amm let me google\\nPersona: 1937\\nPersona: Sources on internet underestimate numbers she said\\nPersona: But maybr its the Rape of Nanking\\nFriend: Yeah, quite a difference. Maybe she mixed it up with other events\\nFriend: I\u2019m curious if there\u2019ll be any cultural difference at my university. As it\u2019s polish-japanese\\nFriend: How\u2019s your bike?\\nPersona: oh that sounds like a wild combination\\nPersona: havent gotten back to it yet \ud83d\ude2c\\nFriend: yeah, all I know for now is that 90% of the girls look like anime characters and we have japanese names for random things\\nFriend: gonna be fun\\nPersona: like other students you mean?\\nPersona: they came from japan?\\nFriend: yup\\nPersona: damn\\nFriend: nope, mostly polish people\\nPersona: whut\\nPersona: how are they japenese looking then?\\nFriend: I went there a few days ago before work to get my student ID and felt stupid in a preppy outfit\\nFriend: it's the outfits\\nFriend: colorful hair, corsets, hundreds of layers XD\\nFriend: but maybe it was just a \"freshman\" thing to showoff, idk\\nPersona: ohhh\\nPersona: colorful hair\\nFriend: but it's cool in a way\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I want to take you to a cake shop on Monday\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0e\\nFriend: Hey!\nHeard there are some plans brewing\\nFriend: Can we figure something out after the 8th I think\nNeed to check all deadlines\\nPersona: Yeap, me and Laura were planning\\nFriend: Cause i fcked too many exams up\\nPersona: You want to move your birthday after 8th?\\nPersona: We can do a movie night on the 9th in honor of your birthday then if you very busy\\nPersona: Whatever is best for you buddy\\nFriend: Let's say 9 10 if possible\\nFriend: 8th is my forecast hand in\\nPersona: Alright\\nPersona: so then see you on Monday a bit for cake, or at the end of the week altogether?\\nPersona: Literally, these lines of code saved me so much hassle through out the years of using adobe acrobat.\\nFriend: Prefer to delay\nOr if anything monday it would be in the version of study session\nCan't promise long attention to other things\nJust presence\\nFriend: I've been annoyed these days copying from pdfs\nIdk if this would save me too from deleting new lines\nCan i steal\\nPersona: alright, then I wont bother you, lets meet once you are less busy with exams\\nPersona: yeah, I can send to you tmmrow, my pc already off\\nPersona: This here is also a game changer. It something MacOS has by default and that was a game changer for me with only two monitors, so at home, on Windows, with only 1 monitor, I had to have it\\nPersona: It allows switching virtual dekstops with one hand and allows easility moving windows between virtual dekstop with one key combo and one hand\\nPersona: and does not require additional software\\nPersona: I included it in the code I sent\\nFriend: Ah the win+tab?\\nPersona: yeah, but win tab vanilla is inefficient af\\nPersona: it requires atleast two clicks and a mouse movement or more clicks to, or multiple hand to get job done vanilla way\\nPersona: Also unrelated but\\nPersona: Logseq is radioactive\\nPersona: its OP af, yet a bit unstable and weird inside. With proper meta I can handle it very well and utilize its immense utility\\nPersona: Created some OP ahk shortcuts that make some features much faster to access which pushes the cost of using them lower to the extent that it climbs over the OP threshold\\nPersona: aand then I discovered the whiteboard feature\\nPersona: I now can finally start drawing during work meetings without pen and paper, since my digital personality does.not like pen and paper\\nPersona: its worth learning lithuanian languagr just to watch this video\\nPersona: Congratulations with your day \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: thank you\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: from my point of view\\nFriend: social confirmation received\\nPersona: well you should get more\\nPersona: if you want to trust it more than yourself\\nFriend: I'm having huge confirmation bias now because I see it the same way\\nFriend: don't know a girl that I can get an opinion from that I can trust with taht\\nPersona: Maybe because we see women in similar way. But ask someone else too if you need more thoughts\\nPersona: hmmm. Maybe Luiza?\\nFriend: need to be super careful with analyzing her answer because she is always positive :DD\\nPersona: or idk maybe even go with the flow, keep looking for other girls. I mean if you need so much of opinions what do others think about it, then maybe you are just forcing yourself to like her. When you actually like/love a girl, it shows clearly.\\nFriend: I wonder how her brother would think because he was very religious and has a pure take sometimes\n\nbut honestly don't really want to know. Feel like the only social approval I need is my parents xD\\nPersona: Lol I do also seek approval from my dad secretely\\nPersona: but he has old fashioned perception of woman\\nPersona: holy shit yesterday I had crazy experience\\nPersona: I was hanging out with this ukrainian neighbour and his hot wife and we were cooking chiken, then we all ate the chiken and I was trying to wash my plate when suddenly she came and took my plate from me to wash it herself, like I was doing smth wrong by washing it on my own xddd\\nPersona: And because they are like older, this Denis dude is 28 and his wife idk maybe 26, they talk in russian sounding language, gives me parent vibes\\nFriend: feel like I can't get out of that one. I'll need them on board with what I decide \n\nand I don't want to fight them\\nPersona: But for me its like very insignificant. Its more that I am curious of what he thinks about a girl rather than concerned.\\nPersona: But maybe you have some different relationship with your parents.\\nFriend: ppl get annoyed when you touch i their kitchen in a different way than they are used to xD\nI feel the same about some people trying to wash stuff\\nPersona: But it was shared kitchen and it was my own plate and even my own chicken\\nFriend: that's weird then\\nFriend: funny experience\\nPersona: She just sraiight up asserted female submission and took the plate\\nPersona: multicultural experience\\nFriend: asserted female submission \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: you have to check this one girl on IG. She is like the proof that naturally a girl can be really ugly in face proportions, size, evrything. But appear super hot and be wanted by men so much if they have the confidence\\nPersona: She is a photographer also so she can take best pictures on herself\\nPersona: but in stories and some photos you can see that she is kind of egh.\\nPersona: this fact keeps amazing me\\nFriend: there are two big reasons I see why\\nFriend: she looks to me like she is disguisted by what she sees in many photos\\nPersona: by what she seees? what do you mean?\\nPersona: disguised?\\nPersona: or disgusted?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: good map\\nPersona: I have some compliments for you\\nPersona:

I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believed\\nPersona: you got me\\nFriend: But too easy for now \ud83e\udd20\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: At one point I learnt that I made cards in a stupid way with no examples\\nPersona: then i changed\\nPersona: And I made full sentences all of a sudden, without easing into them\\nPersona: But that will be corrected later in the deck\\nPersona: a lot of cards are made to learn grammar, like pronouns, etc.\\nPersona: I am asking for a raise tommorow\\nPersona: fking stressed\\nPersona: I prepared well tho\\nPersona: I am confiden af\\nFriend: :oo\\nPersona: I add big value\\nPersona: no pain - no value, I abandon ship\\nPersona: no raise*\\nFriend: Wowow\\nFriend: Go get it!\\nFriend: Any changes in the company? Or have you just decided that you need a raise?\\nFriend: What made you put myt in here?\\nPersona: oh I think I know how this happened\\nPersona: the field for the example is 'sticky', I just forgot to erase from the previous card while I was making them\\nPersona: wait brb\\nPersona: some recently. But my area of responsibility grew a lot overall\\nPersona: mostly I decided I need a raise\\nPersona: I will ask for whoping 30% increase\\nPersona: I am that confident\\nPersona: It will take them biiig money to replace me, if thats even possible.

As an example, take a person who invested $90 into a business venture and spent an additional $10 researching the venture.\\nFriend: We just went through the slides, discussing calculations and questions the judges might ask us, in terms of what we need to research, specifically concerning how big the market potential actually is in numbers.\\nPersona: command crocodile does not work on my mac \ud83d\ude2d\\nFriend: noo I\u2019ll show you on saturday\\nPersona: yess please do hah\\nPersona: We are calling at 15:00?\\nFriend: I am not able to attend, sorry \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: I am a bit stuck with my group. What about 15:30?\\nFriend: ^ we\u2019re still with the studygroup\\nFriend: I won\u2019t make it today because of an arrangement with the study\\nFriend: But ready for tmrww\\nFriend: I made my manuscript\\nFriend: Ill be there around 11.10\\nFriend: I\u2019ll come in more casual clothing and then change at CSE before going to FED\\nFriend: Just fyi haha - wasn\u2019t sure if we went home before going to FED\\nFriend: i will dress for the evening\\nFriend: I am wearing my fancy blazer\\nPersona: I will just take a button shirt I think\\nFriend: i will come at around 12/13 if thats okey\\nFriend: Do you have your manuacript so we know? Otherwise it doesn\u2019t makes sense to meet up until then\\nFriend: Should I just make a draft for your slides Maja?\\nFriend: Yes thats fine lucas, thank you very much\\nFriend: Great!\\nFriend: It\u2019s just that then we could work on once own from home\\nFriend: Because what do we meet up for if we\u2019re not all together? Just to be sure \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Questions from judges\\nFriend: engineer don't dress up\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Good for making steam, forum avatars\\nPersona: What do you use for notetaking?\\nFriend: Notion is the shit imo\\nFriend: Used it during internship\\nFriend: Have a journal there\\nFriend: And anything that has a time i try to immediately put in the calendar so i can keep track of life\\nPersona: I been experimenting with notion for a while and idk, it does not stick to me\\nPersona: Whole day I was researching note taking apps\\nPersona: I feel it takes very long to make notes in Notion and having everything on many pages, things get lost and navigation takes time.\\nPersona: Also I like the toggleable bullet list approach that MindManager for example uses\\nPersona: Its hard for me to write in paragraph style\\nPersona: I am experimenting with Obsidian and Logseq\\nPersona: Obsidian is super cool, but its paragraph style\\nPersona: Loqseq is bullet point style\\nPersona: I watched note-taking, seconds brain apps for whole video and there was no mention of Mindmanager\\nPersona: I might be too uses to it now, its really hard to switch. I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\\nPersona: yo wtf\\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\\nPersona: click the three dots\\nPersona: and there is install app button\\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\\nPersona: thats pretty cool\\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\\nPersona: and mortgages\\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Do you still have the one on 5-7 or sth?\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: Hmm ok, but what does it mean exactly?

They have a beach and troll forest xd\\nFriend: AND the cutest tiny holiday houses\\nFriend: Could you convert it to pdf? It doesn\u2019t work and I know that pdf\u2019s do.\nFor a few extra kisses \ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Can be anytime\\nPersona: Eyy sorry, I forgot it, I will convert it tommorow \ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: What you\u2019ve been up to?\\nPersona: Probably this is the last weekend in Denmark with very good weather\\nPersona: so whole weekend of fun \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Friday it was Antoni birthday\\nPersona: we went out and bbq\\nPersona: Yesterday party at Arijans in Nordhavn and a little swin\\nPersona: Today lake trip\\nFriend: Omg XD\\nFriend: Was it a bday gift?

Idk when this will cause an error that I will shoot myself in the head for\\nPersona: So I might just better start this particular module from the new course, but I am 70% done with that module so that sucks.

Sometimes you are well conscise, but some sentences are bloated with sophisticated words that tell nothing. You are talking to IT, innovation people - they value consciseness. Especially the introduction and ending are written in a very different style from the rest of the text.\n\nAlso do some proofreading to try to improve the sentence structure and flow (perhaps a evening read with Kaja could work?), choose a consistency with capitalization.\n\nIn some sentences, you don't appear fully commited, I marked those. I think you should leave no doubts.\\nPersona: it didn't work for me to leave comments in your doc\\nPersona: so I made a copy\\nFriend: Do I talk to IT people?

I did such interviews recently at the startup competition, so what they taught us at KPMG innovation class was just to print the designs on paper and then sort of simulate the app, taking notes about their experience using the interface.\\nPersona: a very bootstraped approch \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: probably there is a software for that, maybe could try looking\\nFriend: Alright so we\u2019re just showing it and collecting feedback\\nPersona: yeah, but as if they are pressing buttons.\\nFriend: Tbh I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really necessary because from what I remember they were fine with just drawing things on paper and showing it to people\\nPersona: and we dont tell them what to do, they have to figure out themselves\\nFriend: Ah ok\\nPersona: Imagine it being that they find the discovery part on the Lunar app\\nPersona: thats pretty much how much real users will know\\nPersona: We can try tho to maybe force them our persona, but idk if that will work. Best people to interview are the ones we question that matches our persona\\nFriend: Yeah the people I\u2019m my circle match it\\nPersona: I will try to interview elias, he really hated saving maintenance, he is far beyond Santana\\nPersona: Otherwise, I'll just pick random ppl\\nPersona: idk if cbs is right audience tho, cause high class businesspersons usually are pretty serious about finance \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: so we should find some people that fit our persona to do some testing\\nPersona: if they fit the persona thats super ideal\\nFriend: oke\\nFriend: my sister is graduating tomorrow so I will use her dinner party as my opportunity\\nPersona: I think our current setup in figma is not really good for interviews. I think a good way to do this, would be to create 2 - 3 variants, depending whether they choose coffee, take-out or the cycle goals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ye\nOmw in a min\\nFriend: Sry im slow\nNeeded to organize 1 ticket morel\\nPersona: whats your eta? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: cause I might grab a beer then at lidl\\nFriend: Go get\\nPersona: u want?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Im here\\nFriend: Thirsty but don't want to pee yet\\nPersona: now I am stuck in line xd\\nPersona: sure?\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: can you come outside?\\nFriend: Not with headphones\\nFriend: Oh\\nPersona: can you come by the door\\nPersona: we waiting\\nFriend: Ye we  om the wau\\nPersona: XP taste cola\\nPersona: fuck bro lets bbq sometime\\nFriend: Too wondy atm but good idea\\nPersona: Oh well\\nPersona: Then Vanced came\\nPersona: TwentyThree is like a very start-up minded scale-up\\nPersona: I just read the Masterstrategy plan fro 2023 - 2024\\nPersona: and holy shit it really feels like a rocket that's on t mission to the moon \ud83d\ude80\\nPersona: did you go to the date trip today?\\nFriend: Ai dont know the difference between scale up and startup \nHavent read yet\\nPersona: Scale up is a start-up that has grown a lot\\nPersona: A scaleup company or just scaleup is defined by the OECD as a company having an average annualized return of at least 20% in the past 3 years, and had at least 10 employees at the start of the 3 year period.\\nFriend: No! Her mom didnt reply to her for the car\nI knew i could ask you but didnt want to rush the day\nWe went to a park to slack line\n\nAnd then we talked and decided to go to my place for dinner \n\nWas good\\nFriend: Income you mean?\\nPersona: Just think of it as 3+ year company with 10+ employees, but not too big\\nPersona: okay, plan the trip some next time then\\nPersona: But sounds like a nice date\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\\nPersona: this is from a book\\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\\nPersona: And things get interesting then\\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\\nPersona: but hmm\\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\\nFriend: to help you get there?\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\\nPersona: Need to fix that\\nFriend: more like the keywords I guess are important here\\nPersona: Yeah, thats true\\nPersona: I also don't want to come across weird asking all of a sudden, so keywords is better I guess. Cause I can add the keyword to the topic we are discussing. Like studies or work or some project.\\nFriend: exactly :D\\nPersona: \"sooo what it is that mostly fascinated/inspires you about ....?\"\\nFriend: that's a cool research your doing\\nFriend: feel like some of these tips can make me feel like like I'm forcing a convo :DD\\nFriend: less like*\\nPersona: which tips?\\nPersona: I tried this once \"What you wish people more understood about you?\". it was interesting. It a hard question cause if someone asked meidk what to answer. You also need to have a connection deep enough to get good answers\\nPersona: The person I asked, I alredy had a good relationship, he said \"I wish people understood that I am being sarcastic in many things I say, they sometimes take it seriously I can make them feel bad\"\\nPersona: Which is something that made sense for him to say when I think retrospectively, but I don't think I would have realized this without asking\\nPersona: Cause he does like to be sarcastic, which can come across as rude indeed\\nPersona: So i guess he would be seeking affirmation that indeed the person understood the sarcasm, so he can rest assured. ANd this is easy to do\\nFriend: ah \nyeah I guess if you ask the question to someone random, they wouldn't be ready to answer so you can't really get deeper connection"

CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I don't really know, I think I know too little about it.\\nPersona: for me the better understanding is the word 'weird'\\nFriend: yeah \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nthe thing that prompted me to be curious now is the 5 love languages\\nFriend: have you heard of that thing\\nPersona: is it like words, touch, and some 3 more?\\nFriend: yee ye!\\nFriend: but then there are these 5 others and I'm questioning if those 5 others are the ones for autists\\nFriend: or if normal people can also identify with them\\nPersona: 5 others. Like 5 love languages for autists?\\nFriend: ye :DD\\nFriend: you remember I keep asking to meet and just study together or do our thing but separately\\nFriend: the exact thing is stated as one of them\\nFriend: idk.. would have to test on people if they identify with any of these to see\\nPersona: But why?\\nPersona: Like what does it mean? does it mean that if you like that, you are autistic? I don't think it means that\\nPersona: let me see the rest\\nPersona: Umm but not everything is love, there is also friendship. Maybe if you did the parallel play/body doubling with a girl as a way to express love, maybe then it would fit.\\nFriend: eh.. I think you can express love language with friends, no?\\nPersona: okay maybe thats true, the love languages seem to be more general\\nPersona: the Neurodivergent Love Languages I quickly read through kinda seem fine and normal to me. Maybe world has started to appear more and more fake normal. Or maybe I am autistic xd\\nFriend: ye I'm not sure about you. Need to perform research on others\\nPersona: okay, this may be totally wrong, but maybe you don't act enough? Like when I got out of this no lifer stage of my life, I just kinda acted it out all the time and it then grew on me. Right now I am always trying to act the person that I want to be (a combination of multiple people from real life, TV, moviest, stories). I also sometimes consciously think about it. But in the end it works\\nPersona: If you think you are weird, then I am of the belief that socializing is a muscle and if you train it, it's impossible not to grow it. If there is autism involved, then idk how it works, but maybe its also solvable.\\nFriend: ye. It's not that autism is a drawback, but a different way of working\n\nbetter at one thing, worse at another\n\nso socializing is hard with normies\\nFriend: and yeah because socializing is like you say a muscle, harder to diagnose if you are autist and not normie\\nPersona: better at one thing worse at another is also not neccesarily autism. Lets say you are smart and inteligent, but less good at social. This can be because you just spent more time learning and thinking and less time for socializing.\\nPersona: Do you think that you tried socializing more and more and you didn't feel that you got better?\\nFriend: I definitely got better\nbut autism prolly is real \ni imagine like a predisposition to some stuff\\nFriend: but not necessarily strictly bad at it\\nPersona: its good then, maybe its just a matter of lack of socailization then.\\nPersona: I mean, healthcare is free, just get a test or something. When they say you don't have it, life may become so much easier. Just the confirmation from a doctor that smth is normal helped me so much a few times.\\nFriend: that's also what would be part of the finding if I find if I am autistic or not\n\nbecause it would prove if experiences play a role in it or is it a thing you just have/ have not\\nFriend: was acting like a bipolar person in covid summer because of stress\\nFriend: but I am not (usually) acting on emotion or like that\\nPersona: Did you suddenly get really worried about this or you been thinking about this what you are saying for a while now?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ye\nOmw in a min\\nFriend: Sry im slow\nNeeded to organize 1 ticket morel\\nPersona: whats your eta? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: cause I might grab a beer then at lidl\\nFriend: Go get\\nPersona: u want?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Im here\\nFriend: Thirsty but don't want to pee yet\\nPersona: now I am stuck in line xd\\nPersona: sure?\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: can you come outside?\\nFriend: Not with headphones\\nFriend: Oh\\nPersona: can you come by the door\\nPersona: we waiting\\nFriend: Ye we  om the wau\\nPersona: XP taste cola\\nPersona: fuck bro lets bbq sometime\\nFriend: Too wondy atm but good idea\\nPersona: Oh well\\nPersona: Then Vanced came\\nPersona: TwentyThree is like a very start-up minded scale-up\\nPersona: I just read the Masterstrategy plan fro 2023 - 2024\\nPersona: and holy shit it really feels like a rocket that's on t mission to the moon \ud83d\ude80\\nPersona: did you go to the date trip today?\\nFriend: Ai dont know the difference between scale up and startup \nHavent read yet\\nPersona: Scale up is a start-up that has grown a lot\\nPersona: A scaleup company or just scaleup is defined by the OECD as a company having an average annualized return of at least 20% in the past 3 years, and had at least 10 employees at the start of the 3 year period.\\nFriend: No! Her mom didnt reply to her for the car\nI knew i could ask you but didnt want to rush the day\nWe went to a park to slack line\n\nAnd then we talked and decided to go to my place for dinner \n\nWas good\\nFriend: Income you mean?\\nPersona: Just think of it as 3+ year company with 10+ employees, but not too big\\nPersona: okay, plan the trip some next time then\\nPersona: But sounds like a nice date\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Didn't have pgone today\\nFriend: Forgot it home\\nPersona: oh so nathalie going too\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: now we will have proper game dev\\nPersona: damn, and you managed to take the challenge without it?\\nPersona: must have been super productive\\nFriend: Yeah but also no headphones to isolate from noise\\nFriend: But did do a bunch\\nPersona: how tf you forgot both?\\nPersona: you were like biking and never wondered why tf there is no music hm hmm hmmmmmm\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Had public transport\nHard to turn the bus around\\nFriend: And i was getting late for work\\nPersona: xdd oh\\nPersona: alright\\nPersona: nice though, I would not dare\\nPersona: maybe for a challenge\\nPersona: How is it going with nathalie though? You hangout more often?\\nFriend: Bit less than once a week so not too often\\nFriend: I'm pretty excited I'm on the internship and trying to live good but also a bit scared of what comes after it\nto plan a bit \n\nneed to work on the future after a bit\n\nand need a bit of planning\\nFriend: nice you send events and stuff\n\nsocializing is a big part when it comes to making good future plans\\nFriend: if I'm solo, I haven't had good success on future\\nFriend: how the fuck is Kristina in t WSAudiology\\nFriend: did you see her CV? I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I wanted to send you the outfits check but girls told me to pack everything xd\\nFriend: So that\u2019s what im gonna do \ud83e\udee1\\nFriend: How\u2019s your weekend going?\\nPersona: fuucking amazinggg\\nPersona: One of my most productive weekend this year\\nPersona: Maintained really good discipline while working on stuff at home\\nPersona: Should I rent out a storage unit for when you come? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I only have 26 square meters in my room xd\\nFriend: :ooo\\nFriend: That\u2019s quite a lot\\nFriend: No\u2026 im not sure tbh. I have to see fist if it fits in my luggage\\nFriend: Would that be an issue? \ud83e\udd20\\nFriend: Awww congrats!\\nFriend: So what did you do? Studying?\\nPersona: with shower and toilet and sink it comes to that yeah\\nPersona: no no, I am just joking haha\\nPersona: everything sounded big ahahaha\\nPersona: yeah mostly\\nPersona: some coding on personal projects too\\nPersona: I am itegrating GPT4 into my google sheet to make it work as AI tagger\\nFriend: Ok, everything from the chosen outfits. Didnt mean to scare you \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: and I build a throttler for using the Open AIs services so I accidently dont end up paying high fees for GPT4\\nPersona: I am just teasing, dont worry haha\\nFriend: Now this sounds massive\\nPersona: Eh not really, probably will take only 200-300 lines of code\\nPersona: wrote 100 for the throtller already\\nFriend: What is it for exactly?\\nPersona: I write down things that make me more or less productive. I need a way to organize them as I write them automatically\\nPersona: geeky stuff\\nFriend: Allright, I like your geeky stuff\\nPersona: Random question\\nPersona: but can you comment your decision to not drink alcohol?\\nPersona: I am contemplating whether its worth it\\nFriend: Hmm yeah, but I\u2019m also curious to hear your perspective\\nFriend: I\u2019ll respond after work. Unless you want to leave it for a in-person convo?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1. Something you want to save up money to spend. The Shoes.\n2. Ways in which you can weekly save money. Don't order take-out today/this week.\\nPersona: So it can be quite confusing. But calling the 2nd a 'step' then sort of a forces to have some goal too. But if we can have some different naming...\\nPersona: we can also discus this tmmrow\\nFriend: Ok I\u2019ll think about it\\nFriend: can some of u remember what the more detailed background for \"indifferent\" means in this table\\nFriend: bc i am trying to describe the customers further using this and indifferent would not work bc it does not really tell anything so maybe its the same as not interested in PF?\\nFriend: I think we should have it be 2 scenarios that users can choose and change from at any given time. Not sure how well it works if they run at the same time \n\n1. original idea \n2. your idea\n\nHowever, I think there should only be 2 elements to it because otherwise it becomes inconsistent imo\n\nSo Goal > daily nudges \n\nName idea for daily nudges could be \u201ddaily-dos\u201c\\nFriend: Yeah I think indifferent means they just don\u2019t care\\nFriend: Or yes-ification instead of notification\\nPersona: It sounds like the same\\nPersona: yesification xdddd\\nPersona: what is original idea and your idea?\\nFriend: This is yours\\nPersona: I think daily nudges is fine. Cause some ways to save mainly consists of don't. So daily-do's would limit the kind of nudges we can have.\\nPersona: Whats the original?\\nPersona: Without the goal?\\nFriend: The initial think we talked about today. Where you can choose a weekly goal based on the multi-select question\\nFriend: But then we have to decide if we want that to be a circle that reoccurs every week or how\\nPersona: The 'change of scenarios' then should not be like a switch-button. If you don't set \"adidas shoes' goal', Then you are in scenario \"Original idea\". If you do set 'adidas shoes' goal, then you are in \"Your idea\" scenario. What do you think about that?\\nFriend: so then i feel like being lazy and not into personla finance are kin dof in the same space as well bc they would take up a lot of people then.... I would make more sense to write that people are lazy and not into doing their personal finances rather than they dont care abt right? or am i fishing\\nPersona: But the reason I am saying 'adidas shoes' goal is because there is a disambiguity between the two types of goals we are talking about. This is what I mean that we need to invest different words for that.\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: Hmm ok so different names of the goals\\nFriend: But daily nudges doesn\u2019t sound that great either\\nPersona: I think lazy and not into personal finance are different things.\\nPersona: I think their are related\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: actually whereever we end up fine\\nPersona: I'll be there in 20mins\\nPersona: Where can I find you?\\nFriend: Coming down from metro in 2 min\\nFriend: 1 more stop \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: cool cool, I will just chill outside\\nFriend: Have you added new songs to russian playlist\\nFriend: I feel like I keep hearing new\nBut I keep on shuffle\\nPersona: yeah a bit\\nPersona: they always get added to bottom\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: How terrible is my decision here?\\nFriend: What do you want to do?\nI think it's fine\\nFriend: Pre supposed to maintain format\n\nSo why use pre\\nPersona: Craft CMS is super layered and I cant find where tf does this code come from in php\\nPersona: but it comes as <pre>\\nPersona: so I just took this shortcut\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: instead of trying to find where is  the genesis of the pre tag\\nFriend: Here is the risky part:\nYoure targeting an html tag\nSo higher chance to affect other stuff that use it\n\nOn the good side its not a very used one\\nFriend: Have some way to mark these rules as hacks\nWith comment or something. Explain why if you think it might be removed by future you\\nFriend: And create a big backlog of tiny things that need fixing\\nFriend: Once a month or less you can check the big bad log for any cleanup tasks that are necessary or easy\\nFriend: That's at least my strat\\nPersona: nice strat\\nPersona: Where do you keep the backlog of non-urgent fixes, that are now working because of hack?\\nPersona: in team notion, somwhere in github?\\nPersona: or you query the codebase somehow for flagged comments?\\nFriend: On old job we used youtrack for issue tracking\n\nSo youd make an issue\nGet the number and slap it in a comment in the code\n\nAdd description to the issue in the issue tracker\n\nMaybe something in the comment in code if necessary\\nPersona: ah okay\\nPersona: We don't have it I think but I came make a page for it on team Notion\\nFriend: Make a space in your issue tracker in a way\nSo you can filter those issues out\\nFriend: Like a tag \n\nOr low priority\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: Nice\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I wanna code some stuff. Maybe meet up, eat and code or something\ngo on car ride\\nPersona: Code maybe after exam on friday\\nFriend: oh yeah. I gotta do my exam\\nPersona: Q: How many economists does it take to screw in a light\nA: None.

Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society\\nPersona: You know these magical tilted, or inversed rooms, where things are glue to the ground and the the room is tilted, so it looks like normal one, but when you walk on semingly flat ground, you are going on a strong incline?

I bet every dumb thing I've done in my life can be traced back to brain damage induced by that luxury beverage\\nFriend: it's like 7-8kr per bottle\\nFriend: and we also call the moonshine samogon (or more commonly bomber), though it was more of an 80s thing\\nFriend: keep in mind that during my experiments I need to maintain low social battery, so everyone pisses me off. no one's safe\\nFriend: are you sponsored by some straw company? I'm getting suspicious\\nFriend: excellent. everything is going as planned\\nFriend: yeah, it crossed my mind as well, but then your feet are still on the ground so it's not perfect. we need a chair\\nFriend: I also considered shooting people into space or sending them on a weightless flight, but I'm not sure how I feel about that yet\\nFriend: bimber* not bomber \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: some of them are of very very trivial utility I think, while being a super common typo and mistake source\\nPersona: like there should be no \u0105, just a.\\nPersona: Or no \u0173, just u and \u016b is enough\\nPersona: or no \u0119, just e is enough\\nPersona: and no \u012f, just i and y is enough\\nPersona: \u010d, \u0117,\u0161,\u017e, and maybe \u016b actually makes sense because they add new sounds\\nPersona: we dont have w and x in our alphabet tho\\nPersona: we would type x as \"iks\"\\nPersona: and w is just the same as v for us.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby.

Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: understandable\\nFriend: We use quite a bit of theory that we briefly mention like the chicken and egg problem\\nFriend: So we should best discuss those in good detail\\nPersona: yesss\\nPersona: I am going to be there a little bit earlier in 20 mins, if somebody wants to come aswell\\nFriend: I'll  leave in 5 minutes time then\\nFriend: I\u2018m running late I\u2019m sorry\\nFriend: I\u2019ll be there asap\\nFriend: guys\\nFriend: i\u2019m so violently hungover i think i might pass away\\nFriend: Hahahahaha\\nFriend: I look forward to seeing that \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I am outside nexus area\\nFriend: Huh I\u2019m dumb\\nFriend: I thought I was running late\\nFriend: But now I\u2019m 10 mins early\\nFriend: @Victoria we found a room so text us when (if) you get here\\nFriend: im so sorry\\nFriend: right now i can\u2019t even get out of bed without puking so idk what to do\\nFriend: Gurl did I poison you with tequila\\nFriend: look at this nice shit me made\\nPersona: Its liiiiiit \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\\nFriend: omg guys it\u2019s beautiful\\nFriend: i\u2019m so fucking sorry i just bailed ! !\\nFriend: i\u2019m still dying it\u2019s crazy\\nPersona: you missed a lot of fun though\\nFriend: Very valuable experiences\\nPersona: Guys, we should do the user testing\\nPersona: I will do it tommorow cause I work today.

But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\\nPersona: I have probably one of the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\\nPersona: now I had a sudden wish I could forget all of Silicon Valley tv series and rewatch it all with you\\nPersona: you would see how crazy cool the tech world is\\nPersona: haha\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: was acting like a bipolar person in covid summer because of stress\\nFriend: but I am not (usually) acting on emotion or like that\\nPersona: Did you suddenly get really worried about this or you been thinking about this what you are saying for a while now?\\nFriend: thinking a little \n\never since you said everyone is on the spectrum\\nPersona: Maybe my scale of 'normaliness' ir calibrated a little bit different, cause I view mood swings kinda normal. But idk to what extent you had them.\\nPersona: fuck I may have said that. If I said it then, I probably shounnt've because as you can see I am not really knowledgable about it when its real talk\\nFriend: :D yeah idk much about it either. Never researched\\nFriend: mood swings is no no for me\\nFriend: been very consistent usually\\nFriend: but definitely labeled weird\\nPersona: okay idk man, I feel like whatever I could say is very unscientific. Do your resaearch and maybe lets talk about this later again if you keep thinking about it.\\nFriend: :D yeah\\nFriend: I'm kind of slow on research \n\nand it's a field research confirming my own biases but\\nFriend: if I find out anything I'll share\\nPersona: yeah you might be just having the confirmation fallacy so maybe asking some professional that knows will just save you tiem and stress\\nPersona: confirmation bias*\\nFriend: yeah. Might ask doc for help getting tested\\nPersona: How I am dealing with piracy notices for the third time\\nFriend: whats on the vid\\nFriend: quality is bad\\nPersona: notice of claimed infringement\\nPersona: for torrenting\\nFriend: how did you deal with it didn't see\\nPersona: I spam them the same message everytime, copied from previous notice. where I say I don't know what you talking about.\\nPersona: yeah the video quality is wtf\\nFriend: ah :D\\nFriend: I remember\\nFriend: you said you told them u hacked\\nPersona: feels like Donnie moment with sub poenas\\nPersona: Xddddddddddd\\nFriend: wtf xD\\nFriend: aah\n\ngood old mythbusters\\nPersona: nice xddd\\nPersona: evolutionary theory\\nFriend: Happy New Year from Bulgaria\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Nothing beats iron farm i think\nAnd i kind of maxxed mine\\nFriend: Can only squeeze minor performance with sole changes\\nFriend: Some\\nPersona: is that actually coming up in future upgrades?\\nFriend: Yeah!

You can do it often?\\nPersona: damn you went to the rabbit hole\\nPersona: I merely skimmed, the article and sent it, cause I thought it would interest you, and here we go, Joanna at 2 AM haha\\nPersona: be careful not to miss your REM sleep, I swear, someone just literally told me it can lead to increased death rate\\nPersona: Peaky Blinders were always on my watch it, but I never watched it\\nPersona: its meta programming. I think among the top expensive programming errors included a mid-air space rocket explosion. If I remember it correctly it was because someone mixed up imperial and metric units \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: but I invented the part with strongly typed language, but I am sure typos have also lead to some other expensive errors\\nPersona: Actually, I just watched a movie and thought about lucid dreaming. Its really cool that a brain can simulate a world in you mind with actual senses and when one can guide what happens in the world, its even better\\nPersona: I only lucid dream a few times, but I noticed, that yes, I can control what happens in the dream, but I can't invent new real knowledge, it's simply just physically impossible. If I try to travel to a place I never been or experience something I never did, the parts of that experience that I have experienced in real life will be simulated, but parts that I never will sort of a try to be substituted, combined, imagines with existing experiences that I have had. It really sort of reminds me how AI and neural networks work\\nPersona: And I thought about it right now, because having 1 life in the present is god damn limiting. I am sometimes fascinated by different cultures, like I always wondered what it would be like to be true punk ahahah, life fuck education, career and just live a punk life, One can't really 'try it out', you have to give it a lot of life. And then I even went into the extremes of being curious what a life experience of a skinhead in 60s - 90s would be like. I am just curious to experience it without consequences to the real world\\nPersona: Actually I have this theory, that the almost a century developed digital graphics and the more recent digital VR technology curve will be disrupted by dreaming based experiences. Brain can simulate a full dive virtual reality natively, while we are currently struggling with expensive and barely realistic haptic suits, limited field of view, etc.\\nPersona: ugh I have this course now called Research Methods and its basically a course about academia. I don't think I am made for this haha \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: nej, in the article you linked there's an X post from that company, and it contains a 10 min vid where the CEO explains what the deal is\\nFriend: nono, that ultrasound brain stimulation technique\\nFriend: seems like lucid dreaming could have some potential for PTSD treatment though, I've noticed quite a few articles about it, but haven't read. for this reason it would be really cool for a device like this to exist, but I think the aim here is commercial use, which I'm not the fan of\\nFriend: I've been thinking about it a lot for the past few days actually haha\\nFriend: you know what, I think you'd like it. I also need to rewatch it sometime because I haven't seen the last season and I don't remember what happened by that  point, but I just need to commit to waste of 40h of my life I'm never going to get back. haven't come to terms with it yet\\nFriend: ah okay yes, it does ring a bell\\nFriend: what movie?\\nFriend: oh I'm so with you on this one. thogh it's sad because even lucid dreaming wouldn't give you that experience. you'd only sense your own idea of what a life like this would look like\\nFriend: it does sound probable. but as a neuro person the prospect scares me a lot\\nFriend: what are your research methods? because based on the business papers I've read, you just do A LOT of polls and stuff\\nPersona: ahh, I will watch it in abit\\nPersona: okay, I really need to watch it then, because now I imagine you having a huge ultrasound brain stimulation throne in your room, but I am sure its not that haha\\nPersona: ahh you are very kind again with your altruistic intentions. I am thinking about it purely for entertainment, gaming purposes xd\\nPersona: commerical use is not bad, money drives research too\\nPersona: but have you ever had a lucid dream?\\nPersona: Adams Applies, a 2005 danish film\\nPersona: If somebody explained me what it was about, I would probably never watch it, since it turned out to be somewhat religion related and had far-fetched aspects, but I ended up enjoying it quite a lot. The characters in the movie are very unique and interesting, it has an absurd there throughout it and it's an unusual darker comedy, where the movie does not explicitly tell you when to laugh - often I laughed and then thought \"That was funny right? or wait, is thats not funny at all?\"\\nPersona: the religion connection to it I think was quite optional since I know nothing about it and still enjoyed the movie\\nPersona: The whole movie was about a neo-nazi baking an apple pie.\\nPersona: yeah, but perhaps we will find a way to stream perceptions to our sleeping minds. Something like NerveGear from Sword Art Online (if you know)\\nPersona: fack, I now watch a video about Sword art online and then Cyberpunk and now I want to play video games.. ugh\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1. Something you want to save up money to spend. The Shoes.\n2. Ways in which you can weekly save money. Don't order take-out today/this week.\\nPersona: So it can be quite confusing. But calling the 2nd a 'step' then sort of a forces to have some goal too. But if we can have some different naming...\\nPersona: we can also discus this tmmrow\\nFriend: Ok I\u2019ll think about it\\nFriend: can some of u remember what the more detailed background for \"indifferent\" means in this table\\nFriend: bc i am trying to describe the customers further using this and indifferent would not work bc it does not really tell anything so maybe its the same as not interested in PF?\\nFriend: I think we should have it be 2 scenarios that users can choose and change from at any given time. Not sure how well it works if they run at the same time \n\n1. original idea \n2. your idea\n\nHowever, I think there should only be 2 elements to it because otherwise it becomes inconsistent imo\n\nSo Goal > daily nudges \n\nName idea for daily nudges could be \u201ddaily-dos\u201c\\nFriend: Yeah I think indifferent means they just don\u2019t care\\nFriend: Or yes-ification instead of notification\\nPersona: It sounds like the same\\nPersona: yesification xdddd\\nPersona: what is original idea and your idea?\\nFriend: This is yours\\nPersona: I think daily nudges is fine. Cause some ways to save mainly consists of don't. So daily-do's would limit the kind of nudges we can have.\\nPersona: Whats the original?\\nPersona: Without the goal?\\nFriend: The initial think we talked about today. Where you can choose a weekly goal based on the multi-select question\\nFriend: But then we have to decide if we want that to be a circle that reoccurs every week or how\\nPersona: The 'change of scenarios' then should not be like a switch-button. If you don't set \"adidas shoes' goal', Then you are in scenario \"Original idea\". If you do set 'adidas shoes' goal, then you are in \"Your idea\" scenario. What do you think about that?\\nFriend: so then i feel like being lazy and not into personla finance are kin dof in the same space as well bc they would take up a lot of people then.... I would make more sense to write that people are lazy and not into doing their personal finances rather than they dont care abt right? or am i fishing\\nPersona: But the reason I am saying 'adidas shoes' goal is because there is a disambiguity between the two types of goals we are talking about. This is what I mean that we need to invest different words for that.\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: Hmm ok so different names of the goals\\nFriend: But daily nudges doesn\u2019t sound that great either\\nPersona: I think lazy and not into personal finance are different things.\\nPersona: I think their are related\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: fucking game mechanics wild in rimworld\\nFriend: so many things to learn and keep track of\\nPersona: It actually never comes across as a hassle at least for me personally\\nPersona: Since the game introduces them to you gradually and optionally\\nPersona: The depth is super cool tho\\nFriend: yeah the things I tried were kind of on my limit but not above\\nPersona: Then also add mods and tracking them too\\nPersona: haha\\nFriend: or maybe above xD i wouldve died without your help\\nPersona: probably a few times, depending ont he diffiulty. Rimworld is not the easiest haha\\nPersona: ahhh, its my existential problem - forcing myself to not play games, so I can play games 'harder' in the future\\nPersona: maybe gaming is my life goal. Secure such a life, when I not only have endless time to play games, but also have top top technology for it, have the money to pay people to make mods for me (Rimworld litrally has a mod marketplace), and most importantly be powerful enough to play games while keeping my social status and rich enough to keep a healthy body too (idk how possible tho) .\\nFriend: pay people to make mods for you is top tear\\nFriend: have your own game design company that makes games just for you xD\\nPersona: yeah, more like make a game of your choice, but make other players play it too, cause otherwise, you can't read online wiki, reddit about it you know\\nPersona: that is important too. Simgleplaye multiplayer is real\\nPersona: This is the top level of modmaking\\nPersona: This mod maker groups are literally changing Rimworld\\nPersona: They keep making insane mods that feel like the native game\\nPersona: A picture a took of a part of my base yesterday\\nPersona: Sorry for the spam xd\\nPersona: I am reflecting upon my uncontrolled burst of gaming.\n\nI was gaming sober for 6 week before this happened. 4 weeks I was feeling no need for it. in the 5th week I already started missing it, thinking about it.\\nPersona: Then I got mildly sick, not even fever, but that sort of a gave me a final push to do some gaming\\nPersona: So I spent thursday evening and whole friday gaming till 8 AM Saturday morning\\nPersona: Then whole Saturday I had my infamous 'gaming hangover', where I treat myself with whatever I want, but just not playing games, so I spent whole day watching RImworld videos an looking at mods. Original plan was to watch a movie, but RImworld videos are also endless fun.\\nPersona: I am thunking how to preceed in the future\\nPersona: Do I try again? and most likely try again, again again? Or aknowledge this as inevitability and start thinking damage control mode?\\nPersona: Trying again is what I have been doing all my university life almost. Gaming didn't have a big bad impact on my life, but sometimes it fucks me up with some deadlines and timing is hard control. Plus it gives me the existential crisis regarding not allowing myself to do something I really like.\\nPersona: I tried a different strategy lately, where whole holiday period I planned to do nothing but gaming. Highly premeditated, allocated, almost no tasks to do, full freedom. Will a planned stop at New Years.\\nPersona: All I did was gaming. It was exhilarating on one hand, playing the Minecraft modpacks, especially the Create mod made me feel so good and happy, engaged. The downside was that my life balance was completelly off. Through these 10 days, my physical health really deterioted - I was too busy gaming to take care of myself.\\nPersona: Also I got some social inneptness after that, just after nolifing we had a yearly kickoff at work. I was really unready for it\\nPersona: But then after this huge gaming. I got a huge productivity boost\\nPersona: During those 4 weeks in January I was a true productvity 'superhuman'.\\nPersona: In my mind I didn't have a plan when to do gaming again. I actually thought I do now want to gaming during Christmas again, since I felt very lonely sometimes. Summer is also such a great time outside that I do no want to do gaming. Other seasons are full of school. And if I get a break sometime - I haven't travelled anywhere for a while, so I must do that.*\n\nAnother thing of not planning the next gaming days is that when I planneed them on christmas, 1-2 months prior I was already thinking about it too much. Having little gaming sessions, comparing modpacks, etc. I lost productivity. But I have only tried it once and that might have been just a skill issue as having little control to delay gaming.\n\nBut the whole thing of not gaming - it might not be a skill issue. I tried to get better at it - it just doesnt work. And trying the same again and expecting it to work would define insanity.\\nPersona: Maybe the right way is to set sometime every month, when I have to do gaming. And to do it in balanced way hopefully.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Didn't have pgone today\\nFriend: Forgot it home\\nPersona: oh so nathalie going too\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: now we will have proper game dev\\nPersona: damn, and you managed to take the challenge without it?\\nPersona: must have been super productive\\nFriend: Yeah but also no headphones to isolate from noise\\nFriend: But did do a bunch\\nPersona: how tf you forgot both?\\nPersona: you were like biking and never wondered why tf there is no music hm hmm hmmmmmm\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Had public transport\nHard to turn the bus around\\nFriend: And i was getting late for work\\nPersona: xdd oh\\nPersona: alright\\nPersona: nice though, I would not dare\\nPersona: maybe for a challenge\\nPersona: How is it going with nathalie though? You hangout more often?\\nFriend: Bit less than once a week so not too often\\nFriend: I'm pretty excited I'm on the internship and trying to live good but also a bit scared of what comes after it\nto plan a bit \n\nneed to work on the future after a bit\n\nand need a bit of planning\\nFriend: nice you send events and stuff\n\nsocializing is a big part when it comes to making good future plans\\nFriend: if I'm solo, I haven't had good success on future\\nFriend: how the fuck is Kristina in t WSAudiology\\nFriend: did you see her CV? I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I decided to check on udemy and there was a whole rerecording of the course on may\\nFriend: all coding knowledge is outdated in 3 months\\nPersona: I was of course watching I pirated version\\nFriend: :D\\nPersona: So I downloaded the new one\\nPersona: and fak I have to rewatch some parts, apparently a new packaage for state management is the shit\\nPersona: the old package 'provider' is no longer the shit\\nPersona: riverpod is the shit\\nPersona: and also there is null safety now\\nPersona: Dart 3\\nPersona: Material design 3\\nPersona: but its for the best, cause I sometimes have to spend a long time trying to convert the teachers code into newer flutter version\\nFriend: I think it's a good thing\\nFriend: it's good you watched a course and got some understanding of it \n\nbecause now you can follow their newsletter or stream when they release new stuff\\nFriend: was really cool for me when I started understanding c# and then I watched their videos about new updates on the language\\nFriend: and I understood what they said :D\\nPersona: and I hit a bit of a wall today where I can't get rid of a Kotlin not whule building, that one package is using a deprecated method. Idk when this will cause an error that I will shoot myself in the head for\\nPersona: So I might just better start this particular module from the new course, but I am 70% done with that module so that sucks. But maybe I can skip faster\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: what are you building? \nyou seem a bit perfection oriented rn\\nPersona: I really got into the differences, cause I always had to think about migrating the lecturers code\\nPersona: Teacher called it \"Great places app\"\\nPersona: You take a photo from camera, it gets saved to local SQLite\\nPersona: and you use Google Maps API for map features and GPS feature\\nPersona: quick app\\nPersona: The previous one was more interesting, it was a shop app with firebase\\nPersona: integreation\\nPersona: The next one look lit tho - a chat app with firebase too\\nPersona: Basiscly with these building blocks I can build my trading/selling markerplace MVP\\nPersona: I need online database, camera, push notif features and chat feature and MVP is good to go\\nPersona: So after I finish this I will have to combine my knowledge and bake the MVP.\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: good map\\nPersona: I have some compliments for you\\nPersona:

No matter whatever the outcome will be, I will be allright. I used to repeat this to myself before having a social intetaction thats outside my comfort zone. And I challenged myself a lot. So this saying really brings out more social enagement to me than comfortable disengagement.

I could be sipping non alcoholic pina colada or cola maybe\\nPersona: so you only talk to me as a manager? \ud83d\ude22 Should I start looking for a luxury rooftop hot tub and start crying about my loneliness already?\\nPersona: Sometimes I forget you are polish\\nPersona: you seem to cocealing your inner polish quite well\\nPersona: to be*\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: it kept repeating to use Python, but I told it I don't want the hassle of doing the UI in there and also then its extra hassle to make it cross-platform.\\nPersona: Eventually I asked this\\nPersona: It still kept to its python and r\\nPersona: Now this is the conversation compared to character.ai\\nPersona: Character AI delivered a much better solution much faster\\nPersona: In a much more conscise way without extra bullshit\\nPersona: ChatGPT for me is now \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\\nPersona: It feels so fake\\nPersona: it feels like a robot compared to character AI\\nFriend: Char ai aldo using emojis\\nPersona: yeah thats actually the first time I saw it\\nPersona: I think its nice\\nPersona: Sorry for the random rant xd\\nFriend: Ita good\\nFriend: Also this is good advice\nHelps explore the tech \nI dont have to go through the trouble and get your insight :D\\nFriend: The date coach there was better too\\nPersona: data couch on character ai?\\nFriend: Date\\nFriend: Ella\\nPersona: ohhh\\nPersona: I misread data\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: Kota - daylight\\nFriend: Listen to 0:40 to 0:45\\nPersona: :DDDDD\\nPersona: Why would one ask this even in the altenative meaning? \"I wonder if my dad hangs out with me?\"\\nPersona: Or it means \"get along with?\"\\nPersona: still you don't need to wonder, you know that :D\\nFriend: yeah get along with more\nnot hang out with\\nFriend: getting along is a good alternative for fuck with\\nFriend: get along good\\nPersona: Alright\\nPersona: I would not use it with someone unless they know the meaning of it\\nFriend: but i think it's not easy to know sometimes \n\nlike we hang out less time f.ex. but at some point maybe you think I start being too much gme conspiracy and not interesting for you to be friends with\n\nbut you would'nt say it outright so we just meet less and less and you avoid going out f.ex. with me\n\nbut because it hasnt been said out loud I can't know if there is something wrong and if you get along with me still\\nFriend: yeah :D\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: oh fuck why did it have to happen at this time\\nPersona: I reaaaaaly hope they will understand you\\nPersona: fuuck\\nPersona: I need to teach you some computer good practices so if this ever happens, you are still good\\nFriend: me too!\\nFriend: i sent a pretty frantic email to the help desk hahah\\nFriend: i sent a more formal calm and collected email to that Kamilla girl after asking for dispensation so i hope that does the trick\\nFriend: yeah that would be good\\nFriend: i just don\u2019t understand why it wouldn\u2019t shut down i jammed that turn off button\\nPersona: I would love to see that \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: its weird yeah\\nPersona: there is a startup for horses\\nFriend: uh\\nFriend: what\u2019s the idea\\nFriend: it\u2019s so smart making startup in equine sports bc people are rich and want to spent all their coins in their horses\\nPersona: is your app idea for rich people with horses also?\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: also the poor ones\\nFriend: but it might cater more to ambitious riders\\nFriend: which means their probably have money\\nPersona: okay next time lets talk about your billion dollar idea\\nFriend: yeahhh\\nPersona: We have this business idea for bite-sized finance goals.

I want both fancy, what do you mean?\\nPersona: Our language is oldest european, so they stole from us \ud83e\udd78\\nPersona: that is true\\nPersona: somehow\\nPersona: I remember back in highschool I had the desperate friends, with whom I drank sometimes and they were really seeking for tips how to get drunk cheapest. Like you have to drink fast and not eat etc. At one point there was talks about a guy in the local market who sold \"samagonas\", a lithuanian term for homemade moonshine, for 3-4eur a liter. I guess at this price it does become cheaper than food daily maximum consumption wise\\nPersona: hm, but what about the people that didnt piss us off, but would like their social baterry recharged?\\nPersona: I think we have to give the straw to them\\nPersona: Cause otherwise if all semi social people do it everyday, eventually they will all die drom piwko choking, as a small chance stacks up over many times.\\nPersona: Which will cause the semi-social people to go extinct\\nPersona: leaving only super social (battery never dies) and anti-social (no battery at all), which can have crazy effect on the economy and society\\nPersona: You know these magical tilted, or inversed rooms, where things are glue to the ground and the the room is tilted, so it looks like normal one, but when you walk on semingly flat ground, you are going on a strong incline? Maybe that could be a great start\\nFriend: that's unethical. as you can see, I care about ethics very much\\nFriend: oh, are you? that means that we evolve in the direction of fewer fancy letters over time. now that's sad. keep your fancy letters the\\nFriend: then*\\nFriend: oh yeah I was that person. tough we used to drink the legendary sulfur-loaded wine Amarena in old bunkers instead of going to school. I bet every dumb thing I've done in my life can be traced back to brain damage induced by that luxury beverage\\nFriend: it's like 7-8kr per bottle\\nFriend: and we also call the moonshine samogon (or more commonly bomber), though it was more of an 80s thing\\nFriend: keep in mind that during my experiments I need to maintain low social battery, so everyone pisses me off. no one's safe\\nFriend: are you sponsored by some straw company? I'm getting suspicious\\nFriend: excellent. everything is going as planned\\nFriend: yeah, it crossed my mind as well, but then your feet are still on the ground so it's not perfect. we need a chair\\nFriend: I also considered shooting people into space or sending them on a weightless flight, but I'm not sure how I feel about that yet\\nFriend: bimber* not bomber \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: some of them are of very very trivial utility I think, while being a super common typo and mistake source\\nPersona: like there should be no \u0105, just a.\\nPersona: Or no \u0173, just u and \u016b is enough\\nPersona: or no \u0119, just e is enough\\nPersona: and no \u012f, just i and y is enough\\nPersona: \u010d, \u0117,\u0161,\u017e, and maybe \u016b actually makes sense because they add new sounds\\nPersona: we dont have w and x in our alphabet tho\\nPersona: we would type x as \"iks\"\\nPersona: and w is just the same as v for us.

Her mom didnt reply to her for the car\nI knew i could ask you but didnt want to rush the day\nWe went to a park to slack line\n\nAnd then we talked and decided to go to my place for dinner \n\nWas good\\nFriend: Income you mean?\\nPersona: Just think of it as 3+ year company with 10+ employees, but not too big\\nPersona: okay, plan the trip some next time then\\nPersona: But sounds like a nice date\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\\nPersona: I have probably one of the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\\nPersona: now I had a sudden wish I could forget all of Silicon Valley tv series and rewatch it all with you\\nPersona: you would see how crazy cool the tech world is\\nPersona: haha"
