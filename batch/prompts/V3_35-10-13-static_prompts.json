I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting. I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yo I forgot to reply sorry\\nPersona: I got sick yesterday\\nPersona: like a mild cold\\nPersona: so I dont want to spread it to anyone\\nFriend: You good?\\nFriend: Got fever?\\nPersona: no fever\\nPersona: just runny nose\\nPersona: and lots of sneezing\\nPersona: still worked today, but from home\\nFriend: I found a good minecraft copy btw\\nFriend: good ass graphics\\nFriend: it's in the fortnite game modes\n\nLEGO game\\nFriend: you have interesting enemies\ndecent graphics\nlegoes! \nquests and shit\\nFriend: it's a good minecraft copy\n\nthey added different mechanics for stuff\n\nbut also have redstone tech.

Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting. I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yo I forgot to reply sorry\\nPersona: I got sick yesterday\\nPersona: like a mild cold\\nPersona: so I dont want to spread it to anyone\\nFriend: You good?\\nFriend: Got fever?\\nPersona: no fever\\nPersona: just runny nose\\nPersona: and lots of sneezing\\nPersona: still worked today, but from home\\nFriend: I found a good minecraft copy btw\\nFriend: good ass graphics\\nFriend: it's in the fortnite game modes\n\nLEGO game\\nFriend: you have interesting enemies\ndecent graphics\nlegoes! \nquests and shit\\nFriend: it's a good minecraft copy\n\nthey added different mechanics for stuff\n\nbut also have redstone tech.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting. I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yo I forgot to reply sorry\\nPersona: I got sick yesterday\\nPersona: like a mild cold\\nPersona: so I dont want to spread it to anyone\\nFriend: You good?\\nFriend: Got fever?\\nPersona: no fever\\nPersona: just runny nose\\nPersona: and lots of sneezing\\nPersona: still worked today, but from home\\nFriend: I found a good minecraft copy btw\\nFriend: good ass graphics\\nFriend: it's in the fortnite game modes\n\nLEGO game\\nFriend: you have interesting enemies\ndecent graphics\nlegoes! \nquests and shit\\nFriend: it's a good minecraft copy\n\nthey added different mechanics for stuff\n\nbut also have redstone tech.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting. I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yo I forgot to reply sorry\\nPersona: I got sick yesterday\\nPersona: like a mild cold\\nPersona: so I dont want to spread it to anyone\\nFriend: You good?\\nFriend: Got fever?\\nPersona: no fever\\nPersona: just runny nose\\nPersona: and lots of sneezing\\nPersona: still worked today, but from home\\nFriend: I found a good minecraft copy btw\\nFriend: good ass graphics\\nFriend: it's in the fortnite game modes\n\nLEGO game\\nFriend: you have interesting enemies\ndecent graphics\nlegoes! \nquests and shit\\nFriend: it's a good minecraft copy\n\nthey added different mechanics for stuff\n\nbut also have redstone tech.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting. I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yo I forgot to reply sorry\\nPersona: I got sick yesterday\\nPersona: like a mild cold\\nPersona: so I dont want to spread it to anyone\\nFriend: You good?\\nFriend: Got fever?\\nPersona: no fever\\nPersona: just runny nose\\nPersona: and lots of sneezing\\nPersona: still worked today, but from home\\nFriend: I found a good minecraft copy btw\\nFriend: good ass graphics\\nFriend: it's in the fortnite game modes\n\nLEGO game\\nFriend: you have interesting enemies\ndecent graphics\nlegoes! \nquests and shit\\nFriend: it's a good minecraft copy\n\nthey added different mechanics for stuff\n\nbut also have redstone tech.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting. I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yo I forgot to reply sorry\\nPersona: I got sick yesterday\\nPersona: like a mild cold\\nPersona: so I dont want to spread it to anyone\\nFriend: You good?\\nFriend: Got fever?\\nPersona: no fever\\nPersona: just runny nose\\nPersona: and lots of sneezing\\nPersona: still worked today, but from home\\nFriend: I found a good minecraft copy btw\\nFriend: good ass graphics\\nFriend: it's in the fortnite game modes\n\nLEGO game\\nFriend: you have interesting enemies\ndecent graphics\nlegoes! \nquests and shit\\nFriend: it's a good minecraft copy\n\nthey added different mechanics for stuff\n\nbut also have redstone tech.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting.

I remember you were curious\\nPersona: man signing up for stuff really moves the needle\\nFriend: first time i hear that one\\nFriend: is that an english phrase\\nPersona: yeah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: whats so special about that company?\\nPersona: yeah i did. Then I copied it even though it was really minimal, but it passes the quantitative test \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: do you want it?\\nFriend: they didn't interview me xD nothing special\\nPersona: looks like boring ass company\\nFriend: definitely! If it gets interviews, it must be good\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: so i dont consider risky as good buffer\\nFriend: just ignore it alltogether\\nPersona: Well yeah, I agree risky is more floating and since shitty times (when buffer needed) are correlated with market performance, its an inferiod buffer\\nPersona: But for shitty times independent of market, its still wealth and its a buffer\\nPersona: But getting back to this, I keep thinking about this from time to time. Yeah I could almost guarantee a financially free life when I am 35+, but I kinda feel thats too slow, memento mori, we are only young once\\nPersona: I think its fine though cause the money is always there, so there is an option to change mind anytime and spend/invest on experiences/meaning\\nPersona: I was just thinking if I should increase it to 15% and also if I should save for 'Education' jar\\nFriend: yo how did you calculate the 10% financial freedom\\nPersona: Or if I should put more into jar for trips, experiences, etc.\\nFriend: when you graduate, you know you'll make a hellava lot more money?\\nFriend: the autocorrect of Mikolaj\\nPersona: I made this calculator once. but I assumed static income, of always making 11000DKK mo/ after tax, investing 10% each time and have it yearly compound - inflation. I did not consider getting a full time job, but then also when I have a full time job, I may increase my lifestyle and my financial freedom requirement will grow (I say I need 12K/mo now to be free, but thats given my cheap ass student life, no car, cheap apartment, but when I am full time, I will get used to having a car, living better, so I will require like maybe 20K/mo)\\nFriend: yeah thats also true\\nPersona: I had this idea today that its not worth saving on education. Initially, I thought that would allow me to have masters in a different country, where education is paid, but idk if its worth it. Say I save 7%, after I finish my BA, I will have 20 000 DKK, maybe with interest 25 000 DKK. That will unlock some countries. But masters in denmark is also pretty good, as I would be able to to use up that 20 000 DKK for smth else meaningful, like maybe travelling, connections, experiences, plus when I am studying in DK I get SU, which is whopping 66 K year free money\\nPersona: So the opportunity cost of studying outside denmark is just so high.\\nFriend: for fun experiences I like what Kuba and Patryk do\nErasmus all the way\\nFriend: but it does feel too hard/expensive to get education elsewhere\\nPersona: Yeah cheap experiences are nice\\nPersona: I need to find some erasmus maybe in summer\\nPersona: really hard to do it through-out year\\nFriend: xD Patryk gave no fuck\nwe had project and he just left us for Erasmus program\\nPersona: XDD\\nPersona: Honestly, atleast in my experience, I worry more about studying than I study, I maybe study like 10h a week max. xd\\nPersona: As I said, I just chill on my couch xddd\\\\nPersona: tahts my problem\\nFriend: I grow kind of slow\n\nbut feel ready to learn and make a step at the moment\\nFriend: before I was scared to really try my idea \nhad a lot of plans and ideas how to realize it but didn't really pursue the options. Only a little bit and gave up fast\\nFriend: during other experiences with a friend in a startup I told him about it\nand I told him I want to learn from this startup experience and grow to the point where I would try my idea out\\nFriend: its been a while since then. I needed some more growing but at the moment I feel ready t take the step\\nFriend: but you have an idea and you work on it\n\nimo thats not a small thing, even with some slacking around\nas long as you are progressing in some direction\\nFriend: maybe its bullshit\nmaybe you want more speed and more happening\\nPersona: You mean like capital growth? personal growth? network growth? What was the thing that change that made you ready now?\\nPersona: And also it souns exciting - you are ready to make a step\\nPersona: Yeah progressing just a little bit gives me huge feeling of purpose and a lot of energy\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I added key activities and will have the discussion paragraph done later today\\nFriend: @Airidas Brikas I can text you when I\u2019m done then I can help with the user journey or something else\\nFriend: would it make more sense to talk tomorrow morning? so we are done with those things\\nFriend: Uo to you guys\\nFriend: Idk I think it would make sense to align again today but it\u2019s fine if we do it tomorrow as well\\nPersona: I pefer to have ir today aswell. Tommorow I will not be able to join a call\\nPersona: okay\\nFriend: Then I think we should have it today\\nFriend: alright so what abt 16?\\nPersona: Guys important and urgent\\nPersona: we will probably have interview with someone from Lunar today\\nFriend: Oh wow\\nPersona: Not the best but we have the Manager of customer support and sales teams\\nPersona: But they want us to write them questions before, so they can prepare\\nPersona: So we need to come up with some good questions asap\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: What are our main areas of concern atm ? Implementation?\\nPersona: Do you want to call?\\nPersona: yes, the teacher also suggested we ask that\\nFriend: Yes give me 2 mins\\nFriend: Mimi started a call.\\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: Marcus joined the call.\\nPersona: You joined the call.\\nFriend: Victoria joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: Oh did he already respond with the invite ?\\nPersona: Yes nice\\nPersona: somebody else wants to join too, or just me (that's fine too)?\\nFriend: Is it if you do it alone ?\\nPersona: dont mind alone, don't mind any of you joining\\nFriend: I can't unfortunately\\nFriend: Im omw to the lib rn so i won\u2019t join either\\nFriend: Haha\\nPersona: So interview done. Nice stuff he told\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: cause city is expensive..\\nFriend: and like the guys story about a teacher that slept in his car\n\nwe had at KEA my db teacher sleeping sometimes in uni so he doesn't go all the way to aarhus or wherever he kept traveling from\\nPersona: glad in was interesting. I think you understood more than I did in this podcast\\nPersona: I didnt register the government part\\nPersona: you not sleep?\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: I went full nerd more until 3 am\\nPersona: Turns out Logseq is basicallu wrapped in chrome, everything is build on DOM and css\\nFriend: was going to sleep but I watched a scary vid so now I gotta stay up some more\\nFriend: the app? :D\\nFriend: electron ftw\\nPersona: I will need your help with a funny thing with css tommorow\\nPersona: I think so\\nPersona: I cant get a table eith td th to wrap and resize columns how I want it to\\nPersona: but enough for today\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: shiiet :D that's a real problem \ntables aren't fun\n\nalright. hmu when you ready to debug css\\nPersona: You can directly customize the css of the app, make plugins, its like obsidian\\nPersona: I will try it for a mo then try obsidian\\nPersona: But it is bit by bit checking off all the boxes that was missing from mindmanager\\nFriend: would be nice to hear what differences you found and what features you use\\nPersona: yeah will tell\\nPersona: You working today?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Break\\nFriend: Im kinda getting up now\nGoing to clean home today i guess\\nPersona: nice, same\\nPersona: how long did you stay up? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: lol these new emoji animstions\\nFriend: Til sunrise\\nFriend: What are these\\nPersona: 2 years of android updates in a nutshell\\nPersona: wooooow\\nPersona: crazy\\nFriend: Its evolving backwards\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yo I forgot to reply sorry\\nPersona: I got sick yesterday\\nPersona: like a mild cold\\nPersona: so I dont want to spread it to anyone\\nFriend: You good?\\nFriend: Got fever?\\nPersona: no fever\\nPersona: just runny nose\\nPersona: and lots of sneezing\\nPersona: still worked today, but from home\\nFriend: I found a good minecraft copy btw\\nFriend: good ass graphics\\nFriend: it's in the fortnite game modes\n\nLEGO game\\nFriend: you have interesting enemies\ndecent graphics\nlegoes! \nquests and shit\\nFriend: it's a good minecraft copy\n\nthey added different mechanics for stuff\n\nbut also have redstone tech.
