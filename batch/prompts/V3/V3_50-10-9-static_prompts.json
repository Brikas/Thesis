Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1. Something you want to save up money to spend. The Shoes.\n2. Ways in which you can weekly save money. Don't order take-out today/this week.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I am playing rimworld with her\\nPersona: and she is talking too much about real life\\nPersona: its soo boring\\nPersona: hows summer house trip?\\nPersona: playing rimworld for 500hrs is worth it just for understanding r/rimworld\\nPersona: bruh I spent 30 mins at work thinking how to name two variables.\\nPersona: Bruh I have never seen this before.

I also have high chances of getting free stay.\\nPersona: Thats exatccly what I did in Poland, but before making this I didn't realize I have similar situation in netherlands\\nPersona: Also I had no clue I know so many Romanians, but none of them currently live there, so if I want to visit Romania, I have to wait until the expats mature and get send back to Romania.\\nPersona: You know what would be psychopath level weird?\\nPersona: Image you are Polish and you just met me. You tell me you are Polish. I say \"Oh nice, you are the 19th polish person I know\"\\nPersona: I was reading a theory for an exam and despite the theory I found an interesting example here\\nPersona: I think exactly the same regarding academic papers that are paid. There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient.

But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nPersona: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nPersona: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nPersona: lets check if other have office hours\\nPersona: Rob also has on Monday...\\nPersona: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Around 18:41\\nFriend: he said precisely\\nPersona: Okay\\nPersona: so the cake place 19:15?\\nFriend: yes\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: VI SEEE\\nFriend: S\\nPersona: vises\\nFriend: We are here\\nPersona: just parkes\\nFriend: We too\\nFriend: We parkes too\\nPersona: where r u gius\\nPersona: we are inside\\nFriend: 1 min\\nFriend: Cominz\\nFriend: We parkes already\\nPersona: parkes? xdd\\nPersona: srsly?\\nPersona: Are yoi still.parking?\\nFriend: Yes we just left my house now\\nPersona: whaaaat\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: We here\\nFriend: In front\\nFriend: Smokin\\nPersona: we almost finished shopping\\nFriend: Luiza called you.\\nPersona: Hey, I gave Anna your contact, she wanted to text you\\nPersona: probably about thrift shop\\nFriend: Sure!!!\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: She told me she texted you, so maybe its in the requests\\nFriend: We got in touch!

But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think.

I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

It just needs different names for the three elements.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow.

But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.

Such as \"new Adidas shoes\"?\\nFriend: Ok so we have the weekly goals + specific purchase goals\\nPersona: That or maybe the way I see it is that the bite-sized daily/weekly 'goals' help to save up for the actual goal.\\nPersona: so maybe the weekly goals need to be called differently.\\nPersona: Its like \n\nAddidas Shoes > Spend less on take-out this week > daily nudges before dinner to cook own food.\n\nReal goal > 'semi-goal' > daily nudges\\nPersona: What do you think about this scheme? It just needs different names for the three elements. The daily nudges is a good name tho\\nPersona: and maybe the real goal could be optional in case they don't have a goal to save to\\nFriend: But then it\u2019s not necessary something people can get started on right away. I see the goals at habit building initiatives that ultimately allow users to build momentum when it comes to saving practices\\nFriend: Some users might be like hmm I don\u2019t have a goal rn and never think about the feature again\\nPersona: yeah, so the real goal can be optional\\nPersona: I think\\nFriend: Ok\\nPersona: Because the goal-oriented saving was quite mentioned in the Emphasize part\\nFriend: yeah i haven\u2019t put anything about it\\nPersona: and also we can integrate to Lunar Split payment (pay later function)\\nPersona: Make a saving goal into a Byte-sized goal.\\nPersona: So not its Byte-Saving squared haha\\nFriend: Hmm idk how to write about that\\nFriend: For value proposition so maybe tomorrow you can help me out\\nPersona: Byte-sized goals with bite-sized steps\\nPersona: don't need to write about this byte-sized squored thing that for a joke\\nPersona: and this for a joke\\nPersona: I like the habit building part too\\nPersona: So calling them steps also would put it them in a different way.\\nPersona: idk, do it as you can imagine. Just saying that it would be nice to also incorporate specific goals. That way we can make extra revenue from Lunar Split Payment function\\nPersona: And additionally one of the goals could be to save some money to invest, where we could also make some money on stock trading fees.\\nPersona: So having this as a feature/value proposition adds +2 sources of revenue\\nFriend: Yes that\u2019s a great point. I will have to look into lunar a bit more but you\u2019re right we should include it\\nPersona: If would be also really nice to somehow come up with two tiers of the service, so could be free and another paid. But I can't think of a solid idea.\\nPersona: Okay lunar alredy has a goal feature so I guess we can integrate with that.\\nFriend: Can you send me some resources cus it seems like you\u2019ve done a lot of research\\nFriend: Im worried my part is not gonna be up to year expectations now because you\u2019re thinking so much about it\\nPersona: We will adjust it together if needed\\nFriend: Can you send me the goal feature they have\\nPersona: here\\nFriend: Sounds Cathy as fuck\\nFriend: Catchy\\nPersona: It kinda does yeah\\nPersona: If we can declare the proper naming for these features we could also make something catchy like that\\nPersona: Cause now \"Goal\" refers to two thing.\n1.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: call share screen?\\nFriend: no talk only chat\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: yes\\nFriend: the hulk\\nFriend: can you share browser screen\\nFriend: oh i see it\\nFriend: ye\\nFriend: put the p inside the other p like you tried\\nFriend: idk why it didnt allow you\\nFriend: ahh maybe chrome is smart\\nFriend: doesnt allow p in p\\nFriend: yeah cause its not wrapped in a p now\\nFriend: the strong and text\\nFriend: change the outter to be a div\\nFriend: instead a p\\nFriend: then put the p inside\\nFriend: or that\\nFriend: oh lol popped it\\nFriend: soo change the image p\\nFriend: to div\\nFriend: then put the text p in\\nFriend: thats the proper way\\nFriend: no worries\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: thanks man\\nPersona: Is it better to <br> or to <p></p>\\nFriend: Br is meant for new line\nP p is cheating but gets the job done\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: You can have br inside a p\\nFriend: hey!

My interests, etc. Maybe give some tags to me or something.\\nPersona: But its a big project tho, casue all of the summaries need to be done.
