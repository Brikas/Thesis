The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login.

The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login. If I could build an automated setup that retrieves all of the loan data frequently, looks for differences to see what changed, I could get a good sense of the market and have really assymetric information. Also some people sell loans that are late. If I could get a notif that a loan got returned and is still on sale for a late-like discount, if i could buy it quickly I could win a lot.\\nPersona: no returned but no longer late I mena\\nPersona: I never thought it has a name\\nPersona: just knowing the name its easier to get the minority diasgreeing party to subdue after decision is made\\nPersona: cause giving it a label will make ppl thinks its legit to commit after diagreeing so they can save face and their ego\\nPersona: I will use this\\nPersona: I just used it now on myself\\nFriend: that's a good strat\\nFriend: could make a scraper that regularly refreshes the page or something\\nFriend: worst case is if they have some limits or notice abnormal activity from your IP and decide to block you\\nFriend: can help with the IT part :D that sounds like a fun project\\nFriend: you in dk? what you up to?\\nFriend: I just had my last exam friday so im a free boy for a little while\\nFriend: will just go to work sometimes and do some ad hoc life tasks and such\\nPersona: congrats on finishing your bachelors \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: how did it go?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its liiiiiit \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\\nFriend: omg guys it\u2019s beautiful\\nFriend: i\u2019m so fucking sorry i just bailed ! !\\nFriend: i\u2019m still dying it\u2019s crazy\\nPersona: you missed a lot of fun though\\nFriend: Very valuable experiences\\nPersona: Guys, we should do the user testing\\nPersona: I will do it tommorow cause I work today.

The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login. If I could build an automated setup that retrieves all of the loan data frequently, looks for differences to see what changed, I could get a good sense of the market and have really assymetric information. Also some people sell loans that are late. If I could get a notif that a loan got returned and is still on sale for a late-like discount, if i could buy it quickly I could win a lot.\\nPersona: no returned but no longer late I mena\\nPersona: I never thought it has a name\\nPersona: just knowing the name its easier to get the minority diasgreeing party to subdue after decision is made\\nPersona: cause giving it a label will make ppl thinks its legit to commit after diagreeing so they can save face and their ego\\nPersona: I will use this\\nPersona: I just used it now on myself\\nFriend: that's a good strat\\nFriend: could make a scraper that regularly refreshes the page or something\\nFriend: worst case is if they have some limits or notice abnormal activity from your IP and decide to block you\\nFriend: can help with the IT part :D that sounds like a fun project\\nFriend: you in dk? what you up to?\\nFriend: I just had my last exam friday so im a free boy for a little while\\nFriend: will just go to work sometimes and do some ad hoc life tasks and such\\nPersona: congrats on finishing your bachelors \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: how did it go?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its liiiiiit \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\\nFriend: omg guys it\u2019s beautiful\\nFriend: i\u2019m so fucking sorry i just bailed ! !\\nFriend: i\u2019m still dying it\u2019s crazy\\nPersona: you missed a lot of fun though\\nFriend: Very valuable experiences\\nPersona: Guys, we should do the user testing\\nPersona: I will do it tommorow cause I work today.

The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login. If I could build an automated setup that retrieves all of the loan data frequently, looks for differences to see what changed, I could get a good sense of the market and have really assymetric information. Also some people sell loans that are late. If I could get a notif that a loan got returned and is still on sale for a late-like discount, if i could buy it quickly I could win a lot.\\nPersona: no returned but no longer late I mena\\nPersona: I never thought it has a name\\nPersona: just knowing the name its easier to get the minority diasgreeing party to subdue after decision is made\\nPersona: cause giving it a label will make ppl thinks its legit to commit after diagreeing so they can save face and their ego\\nPersona: I will use this\\nPersona: I just used it now on myself\\nFriend: that's a good strat\\nFriend: could make a scraper that regularly refreshes the page or something\\nFriend: worst case is if they have some limits or notice abnormal activity from your IP and decide to block you\\nFriend: can help with the IT part :D that sounds like a fun project\\nFriend: you in dk? what you up to?\\nFriend: I just had my last exam friday so im a free boy for a little while\\nFriend: will just go to work sometimes and do some ad hoc life tasks and such\\nPersona: congrats on finishing your bachelors \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: how did it go?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its liiiiiit \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\\nFriend: omg guys it\u2019s beautiful\\nFriend: i\u2019m so fucking sorry i just bailed ! !\\nFriend: i\u2019m still dying it\u2019s crazy\\nPersona: you missed a lot of fun though\\nFriend: Very valuable experiences\\nPersona: Guys, we should do the user testing\\nPersona: I will do it tommorow cause I work today.

The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login. If I could build an automated setup that retrieves all of the loan data frequently, looks for differences to see what changed, I could get a good sense of the market and have really assymetric information. Also some people sell loans that are late. If I could get a notif that a loan got returned and is still on sale for a late-like discount, if i could buy it quickly I could win a lot.\\nPersona: no returned but no longer late I mena\\nPersona: I never thought it has a name\\nPersona: just knowing the name its easier to get the minority diasgreeing party to subdue after decision is made\\nPersona: cause giving it a label will make ppl thinks its legit to commit after diagreeing so they can save face and their ego\\nPersona: I will use this\\nPersona: I just used it now on myself\\nFriend: that's a good strat\\nFriend: could make a scraper that regularly refreshes the page or something\\nFriend: worst case is if they have some limits or notice abnormal activity from your IP and decide to block you\\nFriend: can help with the IT part :D that sounds like a fun project\\nFriend: you in dk? what you up to?\\nFriend: I just had my last exam friday so im a free boy for a little while\\nFriend: will just go to work sometimes and do some ad hoc life tasks and such\\nPersona: congrats on finishing your bachelors \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: how did it go?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its liiiiiit \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\\nFriend: omg guys it\u2019s beautiful\\nFriend: i\u2019m so fucking sorry i just bailed ! !\\nFriend: i\u2019m still dying it\u2019s crazy\\nPersona: you missed a lot of fun though\\nFriend: Very valuable experiences\\nPersona: Guys, we should do the user testing\\nPersona: I will do it tommorow cause I work today.

The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login. If I could build an automated setup that retrieves all of the loan data frequently, looks for differences to see what changed, I could get a good sense of the market and have really assymetric information. Also some people sell loans that are late. If I could get a notif that a loan got returned and is still on sale for a late-like discount, if i could buy it quickly I could win a lot.\\nPersona: no returned but no longer late I mena\\nPersona: I never thought it has a name\\nPersona: just knowing the name its easier to get the minority diasgreeing party to subdue after decision is made\\nPersona: cause giving it a label will make ppl thinks its legit to commit after diagreeing so they can save face and their ego\\nPersona: I will use this\\nPersona: I just used it now on myself\\nFriend: that's a good strat\\nFriend: could make a scraper that regularly refreshes the page or something\\nFriend: worst case is if they have some limits or notice abnormal activity from your IP and decide to block you\\nFriend: can help with the IT part :D that sounds like a fun project\\nFriend: you in dk? what you up to?\\nFriend: I just had my last exam friday so im a free boy for a little while\\nFriend: will just go to work sometimes and do some ad hoc life tasks and such\\nPersona: congrats on finishing your bachelors \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: how did it go?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its liiiiiit \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\\nFriend: omg guys it\u2019s beautiful\\nFriend: i\u2019m so fucking sorry i just bailed ! !\\nFriend: i\u2019m still dying it\u2019s crazy\\nPersona: you missed a lot of fun though\\nFriend: Very valuable experiences\\nPersona: Guys, we should do the user testing\\nPersona: I will do it tommorow cause I work today.

The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login. If I could build an automated setup that retrieves all of the loan data frequently, looks for differences to see what changed, I could get a good sense of the market and have really assymetric information. Also some people sell loans that are late. If I could get a notif that a loan got returned and is still on sale for a late-like discount, if i could buy it quickly I could win a lot.\\nPersona: no returned but no longer late I mena\\nPersona: I never thought it has a name\\nPersona: just knowing the name its easier to get the minority diasgreeing party to subdue after decision is made\\nPersona: cause giving it a label will make ppl thinks its legit to commit after diagreeing so they can save face and their ego\\nPersona: I will use this\\nPersona: I just used it now on myself\\nFriend: that's a good strat\\nFriend: could make a scraper that regularly refreshes the page or something\\nFriend: worst case is if they have some limits or notice abnormal activity from your IP and decide to block you\\nFriend: can help with the IT part :D that sounds like a fun project\\nFriend: you in dk? what you up to?\\nFriend: I just had my last exam friday so im a free boy for a little while\\nFriend: will just go to work sometimes and do some ad hoc life tasks and such\\nPersona: congrats on finishing your bachelors \ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: how did it go?\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Its liiiiiit \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\\nFriend: omg guys it\u2019s beautiful\\nFriend: i\u2019m so fucking sorry i just bailed ! !\\nFriend: i\u2019m still dying it\u2019s crazy\\nPersona: you missed a lot of fun though\\nFriend: Very valuable experiences\\nPersona: Guys, we should do the user testing\\nPersona: I will do it tommorow cause I work today.

The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login.
