But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

The secondary market UI and list is just visible at current state, you can't see historic stuff, sales of similar loans and. But the data is available without login. If I could build an automated setup that retrieves all of the loan data frequently, looks for differences to see what changed, I could get a good sense of the market and have really assymetric information.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo. All LT companies\\nPersona: even most lithuanian company\\nPersona: most of these biggest companies here probably have it.\\nFriend: LT doing good\nDenmark too far from Russia to care\\nPersona: Using windows and mac at the same time is so confusing god damn.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo. All LT companies\\nPersona: even most lithuanian company\\nPersona: most of these biggest companies here probably have it.\\nFriend: LT doing good\nDenmark too far from Russia to care\\nPersona: Using windows and mac at the same time is so confusing god damn.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo. All LT companies\\nPersona: even most lithuanian company\\nPersona: most of these biggest companies here probably have it.\\nFriend: LT doing good\nDenmark too far from Russia to care\\nPersona: Using windows and mac at the same time is so confusing god damn.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo. All LT companies\\nPersona: even most lithuanian company\\nPersona: most of these biggest companies here probably have it.\\nFriend: LT doing good\nDenmark too far from Russia to care\\nPersona: Using windows and mac at the same time is so confusing god damn.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo. All LT companies\\nPersona: even most lithuanian company\\nPersona: most of these biggest companies here probably have it.\\nFriend: LT doing good\nDenmark too far from Russia to care\\nPersona: Using windows and mac at the same time is so confusing god damn.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely.

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo.

But the truth is, we know that the scary part for the customer is that, yes. Now, you know, and you you are targeting me. Yeah, you might be right. But we have all the information already. So I think the focus point is that you need you need to, when you when you tell the story, then you need to tell the customer that we're doing this for you, we're doing this so you can save money. And you will be able to achieve even greater goals with this new feature. Because if you tell the story that way, then then then I think more people will be interested\\nFriend: Just had a quick look at the interview and this sounds like a great thing to include in our paper to validate our proposal\\nFriend: If they don\u2019t personalise content to this extent yet and we offer that service that actually a very valuable extension to the current business model\\nPersona: Yes definetely. And as you say, they haven't really went deep into the personalization on individual customers yet, but they seems like they would like to (maybe there is a direct quote)\\nPersona: Also one of their strategic goals is actually to have more people convert to paid subscriptions and he advised to make this feature paid\\nPersona: he also said that they already have some features in their Goal package only for paid users\\nFriend: He says \u201dwe would love to personalise our banking and our features\u201c in the beginning\\nPersona: oh yeah, nice\\nFriend: But do we have to go more in depth about how we\u2019re gonna do that ?

I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\\nPersona: It would be nice to work together live \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I will read the think you are talking about\\nPersona: the example\\nFriend: i can come to the school\\nPersona: Then we could try our luck and find somewhere to sit\\nPersona: I am at the library, but we can't talk there\\nPersona: oh\\nFriend: yeah in the cantine maybe\\nPersona: maybe we can try the room thats only accessible for DM\\nPersona: i don't remember how its called\\nPersona: the one with bloomberg terminals\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: play a modpack\\nPersona: Mc modpack with Create and some adventure moda\\nPersona: big jealous\\nFriend: Im down sunday if you do\\nFriend: Social hacker\nIt's a really good way to do it\nI joined at metro activities that are fun for me from other departments\n\nDuring one \"green school\" talk they introduced some of the companies initiatives for preventing water from construction sites to leak and contaminate\nAnd cause i pay attention i talk later with the people that present from the company\nThe guy had a weird number in the statistic meaning they collected more water than they used which was weird so was a good topic to talk after\n\nAnd like you say that's their work so they get happy someone has interest and paid attention\\nPersona: sunday is raining\\nPersona: What about the cinema?\\nPersona: are we going?\\nPersona: Patryk may be up too, but not sure\\nPersona: We booked it\\nPersona: book fast bro\\nPersona: bump\\nFriend: Ok will do\\nFriend: Yeah!

Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: thats how i started\\nPersona: to my dream scammer pc\\nFriend: and loose everhything at the end because of the scam\\nFriend: tatata\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: I checked some in LT\\nPersona: prices seems similar\\nPersona: but this one is only 4000kr\\nPersona: I know, but I am not buying from Lithuania due to logistical challenges and also outside my budged for a PC\\nPersona: Sending this for you international market research\\nPersona: if you ever interested in exploring offers in lt, skelbiu.lt is the main website\\nPersona: But many there are offers by businesses\\nFriend: That's the famous Patryk's Quasadila\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\\nPersona: looks tasty\\nPersona: What is your thesis topic?\\nPersona: hmm okay\\nPersona: that was exactly how I reacted\\nPersona: me and my new babe\\nFriend: mission complete\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: like in similar companies tab, half of them are ukraine logo. All LT companies\\nPersona: even most lithuanian company\\nPersona: most of these biggest companies here probably have it.\\nFriend: LT doing good\nDenmark too far from Russia to care\\nPersona: Using windows and mac at the same time is so confusing god damn.
