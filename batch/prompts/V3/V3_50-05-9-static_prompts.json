Gonna make Bens now\\nFriend: How r u holding up?:)\\nPersona: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nPersona: eating lunch now\\nPersona: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nPersona: touched*\\nPersona: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nFriend: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nFriend: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nPersona: I'll show you next time we meet\\nPersona: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nPersona: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nPersona: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nFriend: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nPersona: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nPersona: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nPersona: lets check if other have office hours\\nPersona: Rob also has on Monday...\\nPersona: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: huh\\nFriend: interesting\\nFriend: ok maybe cool one then\\nFriend: can make custom stuf\\nPersona: In Notion, I do like the databases, The database views are quite supperior to this, good for management.\\nFriend: how is it during editing? do you also see that\\nFriend: for .md i have 2 windows on vsc\\nFriend: one with the code and one with visualized\\nPersona: most of the time yes\\nPersona: I sent you a video, but is sendin\\nFriend: img actually shows when you finish editing that piece\\nFriend: thats good\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: the matrix thingy is from a plugin, so its looks a bit unsexy by default, eespecially with the embed\\nPersona: but I am sure a few lines of CSS can fix it\\nPersona: u can have borders in kanban too\\nPersona: most of the things here are this one OP plugin that I found, thats why I got so lit up\\nPersona: So its not perfect at places\\nPersona: but Logseq is cool without this plugin too. I like the two way embeds so much. They were my eternal complain in mindmanager, as they didn't exist\\nFriend: what if there is a circular reference \nwill it be infinite note\\nFriend: but that's really cool!\\nFriend: and what are the motivational quotes that show up :D that's neat\\nFriend: can't be CTO before you become coder! xD\\nPersona: yeah, then it will be infinite loop xd\\nPersona: I think it tried once, i dont remember what happened\\nPersona: yeah, anything hashtag #quote will eventually show up\\nPersona: xdd\\nFriend: impressive setup\\nFriend: can't wait to clean my room\n\nand then I want logseq!\\nPersona: I think you will love it\\nPersona: might be hard to love at first, but once you tame it\\nPersona: Literally spent whole day writing this statement of purpose and I am yet to be done\\nPersona: Either I am unproductive, or either I am unproductive or either I set the bar too high for this task\\nFriend: important task\nget it done good\n\nI'll go write mine too\\nFriend: had food\nhad nap\nhad game\nready now\\nPersona: its 22:50 PM\\nPersona: now is overstatement\\nPersona: xdd\\nFriend: if you have time, can I ask you for a proofread\\nPersona: It reads quite smooth\nI think your points match the information systems type of student well.\nNot sure if its worth mentioning the MIO guest student part. I think since you took electives for a whole semester and are doing Digital Business there now, you can conclude/show the same points from these parts. I dont think its bad to have it, but instead, I would cut it and illustrate a few points you made with examples, stories. Something sounding more personal and unique, more you. Perhaps a story from metro? And think that few detailed, unique, clearly personal example is better than many abstractions.\\nPersona: But don't fullly trust me, I don't know how they judge. but I assume that they read a lof of them a day, so the effectivness of abstract, generic sentences probably diminish\\nPersona: I wrote my letter like this (but DTU want it to be written in Excel lol)\\nPersona: take a look at this\\nPersona: its fucked up, on the website they say that you can upload a recomendation letter, but when I called them to ask, it says there is a mistake on the website, that you don't\\nPersona: I went through the hassle of getting two\\nFriend: x__x\\nFriend: Agreed\\nFriend: also chatgpt makes stuff very generic if you don't share about a personal story you want in\\nPersona: yeah, I think so many people use it, these who read have learned to tell it\\nPersona: And when I asked head of studies for advice on applying, she said, don't use chatgpt. And she said that aknowledging that at DTU they are quite open to AI and like to use it themselves.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: do you have any ideas off the top of your heads for theory that could fit for the discussion part abt pushing advertisments\\nFriend: The theories about data driven business models maybe\\nFriend: @Mimi Maack & @Victoria Bonefeld Dahl would you be available to read through the document today at 10?\\nFriend: I could do after 1pm\\nFriend: Or can you do 9:30 Marcus ?\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: Ok Perfect\\nFriend: whats the guys form Lunar called\\nFriend: Victor or Viktor I think\\nFriend: just join when you're ready :)\\nFriend: let me in hah\\nFriend: hi @Airidas Brikas we discussed earlier today that we would meet tomorrow at 10:30 to finish and hand in our project, does that work for you ?\\nPersona: yes\\nPersona: thanks for asking\\nFriend: When and where do we want to meet tomorrow?\\nFriend: 10:30 at s\\nFriend: SP\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be on the ferry tomorrow at 13 so but other than that i have no time tomorrow ....\\nFriend: also I had no chance to look into the customer journey sorry but I have been so busy prepping for competition\\nFriend: if you need me you can call be all morning im in the stables\\nFriend: That\u2019s absolutely fine don\u2019t worry about it !

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating. Oops maybe I am not so faithfull\\nPersona: Say sorry to Kaja for having to endure watching the cheating xd\\nPersona: Xdd I a listening again, this is so good\\nPersona: I watched the video, but I have to think about it \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: What do you like so much about it? The display and placement?\\nFriend: that's a vaild point, in europe we are so free that we don't care about consequences of our deeds xdd\\nFriend: Minimalism, no advertisments, just pure extension of my brain which can improve my productivity without getting me into some mindless scrolling of instagram or fb. And the rapid way you can access the knowledge also sounds like a huge pros\\nFriend: beside that if my friends would use it I wouldnt have so much comfort as it feels like you are interrogated xdd\\nFriend: they can record voice or video anytime\\nPersona: its more about that in US, films are very commerciallized, they must appeal to the mases and thus cant show much disgusting controversial sides. In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party. Maybe yes maybe no, idk\\nFriend: XDDD\\nFriend: ok\\nFriend: I found something\\nFriend: Special\\nFriend: But no giraffe towels for adults:<\\nPersona: it can be just a simple towel xdd\\nPersona: yellow towel would be giraffe enough tbh\\nPersona: towel is more important than giraffe xdd\\nFriend: :<<\\nFriend: But how could you resist the cuteness\\nPersona: what this is even is?\\nPersona: opaska?\\nFriend: Opaska\\nPersona: its a cap?\\nFriend: Tak\\nFriend: Head and wrist band\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: lol\\nFriend: Used by beauty gurus\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: What is this?\\nFriend: Ambasador program for Microsoft, nice indeed haha\\nFriend: My role as an ambasador is to develop my knowledge, inspire and educate others\\nFriend: We get many resources as ambassadors, so it\u2019s a great opportunity\\nPersona: cool, is it somewhere in Warssaw?\\nFriend: Its a worldwide thing\\nFriend: But I do have a community in Warsaw :) mostly Microsoft MVP\u2019s\\nFriend: One of the ladies is hosting a conference in Poland, I might join\\nFriend: And Marta wants me to meet the Microsoft people collaborating with FED \ud83e\udd7a\\nPersona: Sounds really good\\nPersona: microsoft is a big tech name\\nPersona: proud of you\\nFriend: Aww\\nFriend: Yeah, it can help in the future for sure\\nFriend: Soon I\u2019m starting a project with AI, fun stuff coming up.

I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nPersona: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nFriend: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nPersona: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nPersona: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nPersona: lets check if other have office hours\\nPersona: Rob also has on Monday...\\nPersona: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: huh\\nFriend: interesting\\nFriend: ok maybe cool one then\\nFriend: can make custom stuf\\nPersona: In Notion, I do like the databases, The database views are quite supperior to this, good for management.\\nFriend: how is it during editing? do you also see that\\nFriend: for .md i have 2 windows on vsc\\nFriend: one with the code and one with visualized\\nPersona: most of the time yes\\nPersona: I sent you a video, but is sendin\\nFriend: img actually shows when you finish editing that piece\\nFriend: thats good\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: the matrix thingy is from a plugin, so its looks a bit unsexy by default, eespecially with the embed\\nPersona: but I am sure a few lines of CSS can fix it\\nPersona: u can have borders in kanban too\\nPersona: most of the things here are this one OP plugin that I found, thats why I got so lit up\\nPersona: So its not perfect at places\\nPersona: but Logseq is cool without this plugin too. I like the two way embeds so much. They were my eternal complain in mindmanager, as they didn't exist\\nFriend: what if there is a circular reference \nwill it be infinite note\\nFriend: but that's really cool!\\nFriend: and what are the motivational quotes that show up :D that's neat\\nFriend: can't be CTO before you become coder! xD\\nPersona: yeah, then it will be infinite loop xd\\nPersona: I think it tried once, i dont remember what happened\\nPersona: yeah, anything hashtag #quote will eventually show up\\nPersona: xdd\\nFriend: impressive setup\\nFriend: can't wait to clean my room\n\nand then I want logseq!\\nPersona: I think you will love it\\nPersona: might be hard to love at first, but once you tame it\\nPersona: Literally spent whole day writing this statement of purpose and I am yet to be done\\nPersona: Either I am unproductive, or either I am unproductive or either I set the bar too high for this task\\nFriend: important task\nget it done good\n\nI'll go write mine too\\nFriend: had food\nhad nap\nhad game\nready now\\nPersona: its 22:50 PM\\nPersona: now is overstatement\\nPersona: xdd\\nFriend: if you have time, can I ask you for a proofread\\nPersona: It reads quite smooth\nI think your points match the information systems type of student well.\nNot sure if its worth mentioning the MIO guest student part. I think since you took electives for a whole semester and are doing Digital Business there now, you can conclude/show the same points from these parts. I dont think its bad to have it, but instead, I would cut it and illustrate a few points you made with examples, stories. Something sounding more personal and unique, more you. Perhaps a story from metro? And think that few detailed, unique, clearly personal example is better than many abstractions.\\nPersona: But don't fullly trust me, I don't know how they judge. but I assume that they read a lof of them a day, so the effectivness of abstract, generic sentences probably diminish\\nPersona: I wrote my letter like this (but DTU want it to be written in Excel lol)\\nPersona: take a look at this\\nPersona: its fucked up, on the website they say that you can upload a recomendation letter, but when I called them to ask, it says there is a mistake on the website, that you don't\\nPersona: I went through the hassle of getting two\\nFriend: x__x\\nFriend: Agreed\\nFriend: also chatgpt makes stuff very generic if you don't share about a personal story you want in\\nPersona: yeah, I think so many people use it, these who read have learned to tell it\\nPersona: And when I asked head of studies for advice on applying, she said, don't use chatgpt. And she said that aknowledging that at DTU they are quite open to AI and like to use it themselves.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: do you have any ideas off the top of your heads for theory that could fit for the discussion part abt pushing advertisments\\nFriend: The theories about data driven business models maybe\\nFriend: @Mimi Maack & @Victoria Bonefeld Dahl would you be available to read through the document today at 10?\\nFriend: I could do after 1pm\\nFriend: Or can you do 9:30 Marcus ?\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: Ok Perfect\\nFriend: whats the guys form Lunar called\\nFriend: Victor or Viktor I think\\nFriend: just join when you're ready :)\\nFriend: let me in hah\\nFriend: hi @Airidas Brikas we discussed earlier today that we would meet tomorrow at 10:30 to finish and hand in our project, does that work for you ?\\nPersona: yes\\nPersona: thanks for asking\\nFriend: When and where do we want to meet tomorrow?\\nFriend: 10:30 at s\\nFriend: SP\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be on the ferry tomorrow at 13 so but other than that i have no time tomorrow ....\\nFriend: also I had no chance to look into the customer journey sorry but I have been so busy prepping for competition\\nFriend: if you need me you can call be all morning im in the stables\\nFriend: That\u2019s absolutely fine don\u2019t worry about it !

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

And the rapid way you can access the knowledge also sounds like a huge pros\\nFriend: beside that if my friends would use it I wouldnt have so much comfort as it feels like you are interrogated xdd\\nFriend: they can record voice or video anytime\\nPersona: its more about that in US, films are very commerciallized, they must appeal to the mases and thus cant show much disgusting controversial sides. In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

They were my eternal complain in mindmanager, as they didn't exist\\nFriend: what if there is a circular reference \nwill it be infinite note\\nFriend: but that's really cool!\\nFriend: and what are the motivational quotes that show up :D that's neat\\nFriend: can't be CTO before you become coder! xD\\nPersona: yeah, then it will be infinite loop xd\\nPersona: I think it tried once, i dont remember what happened\\nPersona: yeah, anything hashtag #quote will eventually show up\\nPersona: xdd\\nFriend: impressive setup\\nFriend: can't wait to clean my room\n\nand then I want logseq!\\nPersona: I think you will love it\\nPersona: might be hard to love at first, but once you tame it\\nPersona: Literally spent whole day writing this statement of purpose and I am yet to be done\\nPersona: Either I am unproductive, or either I am unproductive or either I set the bar too high for this task\\nFriend: important task\nget it done good\n\nI'll go write mine too\\nFriend: had food\nhad nap\nhad game\nready now\\nPersona: its 22:50 PM\\nPersona: now is overstatement\\nPersona: xdd\\nFriend: if you have time, can I ask you for a proofread\\nPersona: It reads quite smooth\nI think your points match the information systems type of student well.\nNot sure if its worth mentioning the MIO guest student part. I think since you took electives for a whole semester and are doing Digital Business there now, you can conclude/show the same points from these parts. I dont think its bad to have it, but instead, I would cut it and illustrate a few points you made with examples, stories. Something sounding more personal and unique, more you. Perhaps a story from metro? And think that few detailed, unique, clearly personal example is better than many abstractions.\\nPersona: But don't fullly trust me, I don't know how they judge. but I assume that they read a lof of them a day, so the effectivness of abstract, generic sentences probably diminish\\nPersona: I wrote my letter like this (but DTU want it to be written in Excel lol)\\nPersona: take a look at this\\nPersona: its fucked up, on the website they say that you can upload a recomendation letter, but when I called them to ask, it says there is a mistake on the website, that you don't\\nPersona: I went through the hassle of getting two\\nFriend: x__x\\nFriend: Agreed\\nFriend: also chatgpt makes stuff very generic if you don't share about a personal story you want in\\nPersona: yeah, I think so many people use it, these who read have learned to tell it\\nPersona: And when I asked head of studies for advice on applying, she said, don't use chatgpt. And she said that aknowledging that at DTU they are quite open to AI and like to use it themselves.\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mimi joined the call.\\nFriend: The call ended.\\nFriend: do you have any ideas off the top of your heads for theory that could fit for the discussion part abt pushing advertisments\\nFriend: The theories about data driven business models maybe\\nFriend: @Mimi Maack & @Victoria Bonefeld Dahl would you be available to read through the document today at 10?\\nFriend: I could do after 1pm\\nFriend: Or can you do 9:30 Marcus ?\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: Ok Perfect\\nFriend: whats the guys form Lunar called\\nFriend: Victor or Viktor I think\\nFriend: just join when you're ready :)\\nFriend: let me in hah\\nFriend: hi @Airidas Brikas we discussed earlier today that we would meet tomorrow at 10:30 to finish and hand in our project, does that work for you ?\\nPersona: yes\\nPersona: thanks for asking\\nFriend: When and where do we want to meet tomorrow?\\nFriend: 10:30 at s\\nFriend: SP\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be on the ferry tomorrow at 13 so but other than that i have no time tomorrow ....\\nFriend: also I had no chance to look into the customer journey sorry but I have been so busy prepping for competition\\nFriend: if you need me you can call be all morning im in the stables\\nFriend: That\u2019s absolutely fine don\u2019t worry about it !

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating. Oops maybe I am not so faithfull\\nPersona: Say sorry to Kaja for having to endure watching the cheating xd\\nPersona: Xdd I a listening again, this is so good\\nPersona: I watched the video, but I have to think about it \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: What do you like so much about it? The display and placement?\\nFriend: that's a vaild point, in europe we are so free that we don't care about consequences of our deeds xdd\\nFriend: Minimalism, no advertisments, just pure extension of my brain which can improve my productivity without getting me into some mindless scrolling of instagram or fb. And the rapid way you can access the knowledge also sounds like a huge pros\\nFriend: beside that if my friends would use it I wouldnt have so much comfort as it feels like you are interrogated xdd\\nFriend: they can record voice or video anytime\\nPersona: its more about that in US, films are very commerciallized, they must appeal to the mases and thus cant show much disgusting controversial sides. In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party. Maybe yes maybe no, idk\\nFriend: XDDD\\nFriend: ok\\nFriend: I found something\\nFriend: Special\\nFriend: But no giraffe towels for adults:<\\nPersona: it can be just a simple towel xdd\\nPersona: yellow towel would be giraffe enough tbh\\nPersona: towel is more important than giraffe xdd\\nFriend: :<<\\nFriend: But how could you resist the cuteness\\nPersona: what this is even is?\\nPersona: opaska?\\nFriend: Opaska\\nPersona: its a cap?\\nFriend: Tak\\nFriend: Head and wrist band\\nPersona: oh\\nPersona: xddd\\nPersona: lol\\nFriend: Used by beauty gurus\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: What is this?\\nFriend: Ambasador program for Microsoft, nice indeed haha\\nFriend: My role as an ambasador is to develop my knowledge, inspire and educate others\\nFriend: We get many resources as ambassadors, so it\u2019s a great opportunity\\nPersona: cool, is it somewhere in Warssaw?\\nFriend: Its a worldwide thing\\nFriend: But I do have a community in Warsaw :) mostly Microsoft MVP\u2019s\\nFriend: One of the ladies is hosting a conference in Poland, I might join\\nFriend: And Marta wants me to meet the Microsoft people collaborating with FED \ud83e\udd7a\\nPersona: Sounds really good\\nPersona: microsoft is a big tech name\\nPersona: proud of you\\nFriend: Aww\\nFriend: Yeah, it can help in the future for sure\\nFriend: Soon I\u2019m starting a project with AI, fun stuff coming up.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.

Didnt really realize about the humaness myself\\nPersona: For me, the characted development really mesmerized me, since they were really multicultural and the mix of them was really nice.\\nPersona: Its an european film, thats why they are more open minded to taboo topics and are able to touch them without having to base whole film on it, talking about the cheating, the lesbian friend, a relationshio with older, married women, the danish boy having a baby. In US, you can't just casually include these plot parts. But here it had a nice unpretentious flow of them\\nPersona: atleast in my point of view xd, I didnt get triggered my the chating.

In Europe, film is more of an art, so filmmakers are more free\\nPersona: pay 600eur every few years and 20eur a month for this?\\nPersona: I like the placement in terms of vision\\nPersona: but its trying to create a whole new platform and a nee everyday gadget that you have to carry, charge, but only replaces some of the phone uses, so user will need to carry both. Its a longshot. If it suceeds I think it may take decades\\nFriend: Hmmm I think it can replace all of my phone uses\\nPersona: Challenge? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: When it comes out, buy it and only use it for a month, no phone\\nFriend: What are their opinions?\\nPersona: wait I get home\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: im still thinking if I want to make a party.
