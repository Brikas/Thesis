I never dared to try\\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless. This AI is too proper\\nFriend: fuck\nshe is cheating the system XD\nshe is using my tricks\\nPersona: wat xddddd\\nFriend: says last online 13 min ago (i sent the pic 16 min ago)\\nFriend: she is turning social media off so she can delay the curiosity\\nFriend: probably gonna go sleep\\nPersona: you sent the pixel?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: a while ago\\nFriend: same time I sent to you\n\nbut I need to find out what character.ai says\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm gonna focus on his literature. But I'll wake up early instead (my sleep rhythm got me waking up 6 naturally\\nPersona: alright\\nPersona: 6 is a good time, true A person\\nPersona: Btw\\nPersona: but thats a decade ago\\nPersona: nvm, unrelated what I have deleted\\nPersona: I mapped and read through the headline of a lot of research in Software Ecosystems, mapped for you some papers in markdown, to perhaps skim headlines. sorted by citation count / recency /relevance\\nPersona: Also jotted down some potential things to study there\\nPersona: Havent read them, but just tried to gain some meta understanding\\nPersona: they maybe unrelated tho\\nPersona: Not feeling too good about this meeting in terms of what to suggest we reseach and how\\nPersona: Maybe you can look how to pivot off this paper\\nPersona: I havent really done that\\nPersona: ughh why 8am ughh\\nPersona: are you up.mate?\\nFriend: I got an idea 2 how we could approach this\\nFriend: I think we should have it open, 2 let him add his competences\\nFriend: Long ago\\nPersona: alright, do you want to call the 3 minds before call with him ahah?\\nPersona: mins*\\nFriend: Let's just raw dog it;)\\nFriend: Get in\\nFriend: Join the 1st link\\nFriend: u send me\\nFriend: Elias Salvador called you.\\nPersona: I think Carsten is going to be quite good on idea 1\\nFriend: Im back.

Few people got salary increases, yet I asked for a really fat raise, as a part-timer, and they had to pay me, I made it clear I was not fooling around\\nFriend: 1st lol. I never dared to try\\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless. This AI is too proper\\nFriend: fuck\nshe is cheating the system XD\nshe is using my tricks\\nPersona: wat xddddd\\nFriend: says last online 13 min ago (i sent the pic 16 min ago)\\nFriend: she is turning social media off so she can delay the curiosity\\nFriend: probably gonna go sleep\\nPersona: you sent the pixel?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: a while ago\\nFriend: same time I sent to you\n\nbut I need to find out what character.ai says\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm gonna focus on his literature.

Few people got salary increases, yet I asked for a really fat raise, as a part-timer, and they had to pay me, I made it clear I was not fooling around\\nFriend: 1st lol. I never dared to try\\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless. This AI is too proper\\nFriend: fuck\nshe is cheating the system XD\nshe is using my tricks\\nPersona: wat xddddd\\nFriend: says last online 13 min ago (i sent the pic 16 min ago)\\nFriend: she is turning social media off so she can delay the curiosity\\nFriend: probably gonna go sleep\\nPersona: you sent the pixel?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: a while ago\\nFriend: same time I sent to you\n\nbut I need to find out what character.ai says\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm gonna focus on his literature.

Few people got salary increases, yet I asked for a really fat raise, as a part-timer, and they had to pay me, I made it clear I was not fooling around\\nFriend: 1st lol. I never dared to try\\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless. This AI is too proper\\nFriend: fuck\nshe is cheating the system XD\nshe is using my tricks\\nPersona: wat xddddd\\nFriend: says last online 13 min ago (i sent the pic 16 min ago)\\nFriend: she is turning social media off so she can delay the curiosity\\nFriend: probably gonna go sleep\\nPersona: you sent the pixel?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: a while ago\\nFriend: same time I sent to you\n\nbut I need to find out what character.ai says\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm gonna focus on his literature.

Few people got salary increases, yet I asked for a really fat raise, as a part-timer, and they had to pay me, I made it clear I was not fooling around\\nFriend: 1st lol. I never dared to try\\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless. This AI is too proper\\nFriend: fuck\nshe is cheating the system XD\nshe is using my tricks\\nPersona: wat xddddd\\nFriend: says last online 13 min ago (i sent the pic 16 min ago)\\nFriend: she is turning social media off so she can delay the curiosity\\nFriend: probably gonna go sleep\\nPersona: you sent the pixel?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: a while ago\\nFriend: same time I sent to you\n\nbut I need to find out what character.ai says\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm gonna focus on his literature.

I never dared to try\\nFriend: haha I guess I do have a weird mentality around this. it is a recurring phenomenon that my superiors have to force money upon me bc I feel bad for taking it. idk why. haven't psychoanalyzed that part of myself yet\\nFriend: ayy! that's awesome. congrats! \u2764\\nFriend: looks like you're there for the long haul\\nPersona: ahahah same, I have my module 1 exam next week\\nPersona: I made 1000 anki flashcards for it, now I am just grinding them\\nPersona: you are truly a very kind person, in all the means I know\\nPersona: you might need that arrogant wikihow yourself haha\\nPersona: thanks, it was my first time asking for it, I thought about it and waited way too much \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: I really love what I do there, I might stay there for a while longer. But not too long. I like to switch things around\\nPersona: I saw people who worked in the same companies for 10 - 20 years. That sounds really crazy to me.\\nFriend: oh shit. and how is it going in general?\\nFriend: you know what, I'm actually excited about this. I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless. This AI is too proper\\nFriend: fuck\nshe is cheating the system XD\nshe is using my tricks\\nPersona: wat xddddd\\nFriend: says last online 13 min ago (i sent the pic 16 min ago)\\nFriend: she is turning social media off so she can delay the curiosity\\nFriend: probably gonna go sleep\\nPersona: you sent the pixel?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: a while ago\\nFriend: same time I sent to you\n\nbut I need to find out what character.ai says\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm gonna focus on his literature.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all.

I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless.

I'm so sick of having no clue wtf is happening around me\\nFriend: haha thank you! that's very kind of you to say that\\nFriend: oh really? why's that? do you get bored, or feel like you've hit the ceiling and can't learn much more, or what?\\nPersona: mediocre I would say. The hardest part is understand spoken language, And unfortunately the exam is oral\\nPersona: pretty much all of what you listed I think\\nPersona: But it may depends on the personality type, I view myself as more entrepreneurial so I like to have a more horizontal understanding of things\\nPersona: for someone who prefers very targeted depth, staying long enough might unlock a new level\\nPersona: at the same time I know I want to build tech startups, so I can't get too settled and comfortable as an employee\\nFriend: yeah I suppose we're in a somewhat similar boat in terms of phonetic background. and that's not a good boat to be in\\nFriend: what does horizontal mean in this context?\\nPersona: They speak very fast and spoken sounds deviates from written letters even more than english\\nPersona: in this context it means that I don't delve into one very narrow technology or discipline into max expert level, but instead I have an wider understanding of multiple technologies / disciplines, which would put me in a position able to connect the dots bettween projects, teams, partners and even different companies.\\nPersona: So a literral example would be that right now I am working in a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service, think Google Spreasheets, Canva, etc.) company, which is building a MarTech (Marketing tech is usually software used by companies for marketing, so f.e. Google Analytics) product specializing in Video Marketing (using video, webinars for marketing)\\nPersona: If I worked there for 10 years, I would probably become expert in the niche of Video Marketing, but I would lack a more complete understanding of MarTech, SaaS broader categories.\\nPersona: since only a very small part of MarTech is Video Marketing\\nPersona: and a minuscule part of Saas\\nPersona: So for an entrepreneurial, boundary crossing profile that I am seeking, it would be advantageous to obtain perhaps more shallow, but more various understanding of different MarTech, SaaS companies.\\nPersona: Same thing with disciplines, but in my current position I am already very cross-discipled, since I work as a marketing engineer.\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined role below CEO and CTO, so I don't complain about that at all.\\nPersona: (sorry if I mansplained too much, I just remember you said there concepts go one ear in one ear out for you \ud83d\ude05)\\nPersona: these*\\nPersona: I have probably the most cross-disciplined roles there, so I don't complain about that at all. (edited)\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I see it helped\\nPersona: \ud83c\udf1a\\nFriend: it def helped\\nFriend: way less sad about it\\nPersona: i have 5 hrs to write 7-10  pages\\nFriend: oh boy\\nFriend: i mean you did 5 already\\nPersona: yeah\\nFriend: i am very impressed\\nPersona: But the part 1 is easy\\nFriend: i write so fuggin slow\\nPersona: cause of no ideas, or cause of writing?\\nFriend: bc this is boring\\nFriend: do you think they'll fail me for only writing 11,5 oages haha\\nPersona: I dont think they will neccesarly\\nFriend: thats a very vague answer\\nPersona: Cause I don't know haha\\nPersona: But what I mean is that I believe they will not just insta-fail you cause of that\\nFriend: i mean i feel like they can\u2019t fail me when i have down all 2 parts u know\\nPersona: btw 7 pages \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: I am baking this shit good\\nPersona: yeah thats 67% of the work\\nFriend: instead of pretending that i have a good interview do you think i can somehow write that i have notes from the interview?\\nFriend: damn you are fast man\\nPersona: I mean not me, I am just feeding the recipe to chat gpt\\nFriend: i have literally done the bare minimum the whole night\\nPersona: I will do that certaily. I took a 1 hour long interview. Even though I have the transcript, I am not willing to edit all of it.\\nPersona: I will just say I did the interview in person and made notes. No transcript was possible to made\\nPersona: So maybe call it a night?\\nPersona: lol its morning anyways\\nFriend: okay great\\nPersona: But I think you should get accustomed to chatGPT\\nFriend: i am not going to sleep before i have handed it in now\\nPersona: cause now its a skill to be a good prompt engineer\\nFriend: it\u2019s too late\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: yeah true, one week left\\nPersona: I think the pixel.imagine is kinda weird xdd, do you have a supporting line if she asks wth?\\nFriend: play dumb I guess and send normal pic\\nPersona: but then you still gotta send a normal pic\\nFriend: i think better under pressure sometimes\nwill pray that works if i dont figure it out now\\nPersona: xdd ok\\nFriend: im doing stupid stuff x__x\\nFriend: i put our scenario in chatGPT and the chat btw\\nPersona: yeah this is kinda stupid idea, but who.knows\\nFriend: and chatGPT did a normal reply unlike her\\nPersona: Xd\\nPersona: use it to find replies for yourself\\nFriend: look!\\nFriend: I tried\\nFriend: but chatGPT continued her reply\\nFriend: instead of making mine\\nFriend: so it made her reply normal\\nFriend: second time I tried it kept repeating its a language model \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\nPersona: This is not very useful\\nPersona: repeat chat msg by msg and ask what I should say next\\nPersona: I did this with characted ai dating coach\\nPersona: she also explained the possible things that the female means when she says what she said\\nPersona: Charatcter AI maybe better for this\\nFriend: feels like very generic reply\n\nbut I guess.. when she has such a short reply its hard to be good at replying\\nFriend: think ill try char.ai\\nPersona: yeah this is useless. This AI is too proper\\nFriend: fuck\nshe is cheating the system XD\nshe is using my tricks\\nPersona: wat xddddd\\nFriend: says last online 13 min ago (i sent the pic 16 min ago)\\nFriend: she is turning social media off so she can delay the curiosity\\nFriend: probably gonna go sleep\\nPersona: you sent the pixel?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: a while ago\\nFriend: same time I sent to you\n\nbut I need to find out what character.ai says\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I'm gonna focus on his literature.
